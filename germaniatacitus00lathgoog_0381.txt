Neither must it be too large; inasmuch as room must be
left for the equally important divisione of the Burgundiaus,
during the later, aud for the Goths of the Danube, the Thu-
ringians, and the chatti, in the earlier, period of their history.

Modern Saul-io eomes under this category; so that modern
Soulia may be considered as the norbae ol the Alamanno-
Suevic confederatiou.

That active emperor, Probus, coerced the Alcmauui; he
coereed them and something more. He recovered the whole
country of Suabia, and is said ιο have reestablished the limes.

But from the time of Probus downwards, the Alemanno-
Suevic encroachments steadilyprogressed. Before r.1›.300,
they had become the ancestors of tlre present Germane of
vaitzerland; und, by sm. 400, those of the Alsatians and
Bavarians.

Such was their time arrd scene. Strongly contrasted with
tlre Goths they advanced their frontier gradually and con-
tinuously3 and the effect of this is, that one half of what at
present constitutes the High-Germau division, is of Alemanno-
Sucvic origin.

ln individual heroes this division is poor; none of its
lriugs or generals having the promineuce of an Alaric, a
Tlreodoric, a Gundebald, or a Oloris.

Putting together what has been said about the names
Alcmona-i and Suco-i, it is just possible that, of the two chief
members of this alliance, those whose name was German
were (lauls (ibe Alemanni), and those whose name was Gallie
(Socer) were Germano. This, however, is a forcible way of
putting an apparent objection‚ rather than an objectiou itselt'.

If tlre Alemanni, originally, were not German, their
nationality and characteristica must have mcrged into that
of the Saevi early.

Believiug the Vaudal to have been Slavonic, the Alemanni
(supposing cl· to mean olii) would be in the same relation to
the Suevi as the former were to the Gotlrs.

lt is not superfluous to remark‚that the Alemanni and Alani
are undoubtedly confused by more than one ancient writer,—
a pregnant source of difficulty, which it is not necessary at
present to cularge cn.
