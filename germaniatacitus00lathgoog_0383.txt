the true Burgundians, in a manner the very reversezof the
preceding remarks.

The Maporivr‘yot of Ptolemy, on the Thuringian frontier,
were Burgundiau.

But these Μαρούνγγοι are Morooo‘nyiooe.

Hence, the Merovingians of Franco are Merovingians,

not because they were the Merovingians of the conquerere of
that empire, but because they were the Merovingians of Bur-
guudy, or (perhaps, more specifically still, of) Frenete-
Comte.

It is stated in tbe preceding chapter, that part of the
history of another and different population may hare been
attributed to the Burgundians of Burgundy,

Pliny (Η. N. iv. 14) writes, “ Germanorum genera poloque:
Vindili, quorum pars Burgundiones, Varini, Carini, Guttones.
Alterum genus Ingaerones, quorum pars Cimbri, Teutoni ac
Chaucorum gentes. Proximi autem Rheno Istaevones, quorum
pars Cimbri mediterranei Hermiones, quorum Suevi, Her·
munduri, Chatti, Cherusci. Quinta pars Peucini, Basternae
. . contermini Dacis.'’

This place, with Daci, Vindili, Varini, Carini, and Guttones,
is somewhat strange for a people of Franconia. Its proper clas-
silication was, surely, with the Suevi, Hermunduri, Chatti, dcc.

Το this it may be added, that there are several isolated
actions, such as a contest with the Gotho, and another with
Fastida‚ king of the Gepida, which give us Boryoodionoo too
far down the Danube, to leave the history of the Burgundiane
of Burgundy so simple, as it was left in the chapter referred to.
ln other words. there must be either migration or another
population called Boryuodion.

The second alternative seems preferable3 indeed the exist-
ence of such a second populationis so certain, that the question
is, not whether there were two Burgundies, but which of the
two it was that Fastida (or the Gotbs) fought against, and
which it was that Pliny meant by Boromodioooo.

o. I think that these two were the same.
