For the opinione as to the meaning of the term Heiutus,
see pp. 47-49.

The root dur· reappeare in the Terpno-galune of Ptolemy ς a

componnd of reur- and iacim=ionu; just as Boio-bemum=tlteltome
os tie Boii. All this is pointed out by Zeuss, who expressly says
that Hermus-duri is evidently a compound (capuaciaiaiiai compo·
adum) and also that the Τευριοχαῖμαι of Ptolemy means the mma
people.

rna identification of both forms with the modern form Tiar-iugera
(rtur-inqu), is equally probable. The -iay is the gentile or patro-
nymio affin-consequently no part of the original word.

The change from d to t, which occurs between Tacitus and Ptolemy,
occurs in the more modern forma also 3 Dauliades-ing, being the
Old High German word.

This justifies us in considering the population, whose name appears
as the second element of the word Hermon-duri, as the occupante of
the parts between the Werra and the Saa1e3 or the present district
of Thuringia, wherein we find a Targae.

All this is confirmed by the following observatione of Zeuss.
After the Marcomannic war, in which they took part, the Hermun-
duri disappear. Suevia, which, in the Roman maps, filla up the
country between the Bructeri and Alemanni, in its eastern parts,
represents their country. J ornandas, who mentions thern but once,
does so in a loose and general way, and evidently on the authority
of older writers. speaking of the Vandala of the first half of the
fourth century, he says—“ llrant namque illis tunc ab oriente Gothi,
ab occidente Marcomanni, a septentrione Hermunduri, a meridie
Hister, qui et Danubius dicitur.”—(l. 22. From this time forwerda,
history hnows no Hermunduri, but, from the fifth century down·
warda, Toriugi, iberiagi, and Thuringi, in their stead. l'hat the
Thuringians are in nowise adifferent people from the early Hermun-
duri, can be safely admitted, since we discover neither how so con·
siderable a population as the latter, should have been lost, nor
whence such a one as the former could have originated. Besidas
which, the later writers always place the Thuringians at the back
of the Franks and Alemanni, and between them and the Saxona3
this being the original country of the Hermum-duri.

Upon the locality of the Heruauadorum urica I can throw no light.

The extent given in the text to the area of the Hermunduri
requires notice. Tacitus brings them as far south as the Danube.
