ἣν αὐτοὶ ε’νῴκουν, r'oaydyp, ἐπέθεντο αὐτοῖς μὴ προσδεχο.
μένοις καὶ πολὺ ἐκράτησαν· ὥστε μηδὲν ἔτι πολέμιον τοὺς
Ἀστιγγονς πρὸς τοὺς Ῥωμαίους πρᾶξαι, πολλὰ δὲ δὴ τὸν
Μάρκον ἱκετεύσαντος, χρήματά τε παρ’ αὐτοῦ λαβεῖν καὶ
χώραν ys ἀπαιτῆσαι, ἄν γε’ τι κακὸν τοὺς τότε πολεμοῦντάς
οἱ δράσωσι. Καὶ οὗτοι μὲν ἔπραξάν τι ὧν ὑπέσχοντο.

This, however, cau be reconciled with previous passages, by
considering the Astiag-os (or Gordiapar) to have been a free
company, recruitiug itself on Slavonic ground, so much so
as to form the Germanic nucleus ιο what was really a Vandal
(or Slavonit) force.

The Laceings mentioned also by Dion, may have been
similar adventurers.

Hence the names Genseric, dra, are the names of Asticus
(or Gordinya); and the German blood amongst the Vandals
was limited ιο the cognatio or silaceost of their German
leaders; and the Vandals are German only so far as they
are Astings—which is only very partially.
