Gaudentius’s form is not Pnnei bnt Pro-zei.

Dietmer's form is nlso not Prcnci but Proci.

Adam's of Bremen is also not theci but Prone· end Pmctzco'.

'l'his shows thet the sound was thet ol' tc, or tob, or, possibly, even
ebwlt rethor then of e simple -s ,· a matter of some importem, ee it
helps ιο account for the t required ιο melre the root Prone· lilre the
root Brit.

Now comes the important fact thet we find the word taking en
adjectival form in -en, in which cese the s becomes ιΙι. 'Phe substen-
tivel forms are Prnzei, Prosci, Prwecic, Proiectis, Prutzci, Peneo ,·
but the adjectiwel ones are Protbewi, Protlsenic, Prntbewicus. We
ere now getting near the form Britannicum and it must be remem-
bered that the form thus similar, is the form almost always used
when the languege is spoken of-lingus Prwtbcwica not Prusia.

The root Itrws undergocs e similer series of transformation—
Rosci, thssic, Iiwthewicocs, thbenin.

Lestly, the form Borneei accounts for the B.

All this, however, it may be said, applies to the Latin lengnoge,
end is, consequently, out of ploce ; the question being whether
Slcoocicn forms os the root Pron cen become sufficiently like an
, equivalent modificetion os the root Brit· to create confusion. They
cen. The Slavonic word which e German would translate by
Brittios, end oRcmen by Britannico, would be Brit-stoja, and the
similer equivalent to Priatisc and Prwtlaewica, Prut-slccjo.

This gives us then the AEstii end Gothones (or rather the AEstii
or Gothones) es the representatives of the old Prussiens or hithu-

anien Sarmaticus of the Baltic.

In the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries, when infor·

1. The Grtlirzctitoe, the Γολίνδοι os Ptolemy.
