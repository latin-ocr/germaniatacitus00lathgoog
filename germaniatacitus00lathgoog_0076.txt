Of so much more importance than the remarks of all other
writers upon Germany are those of Oaesar, that the chief
extracta from the Bellum Gallicum bearing upon that country
will be given ia munao. They require, however, certain

preliminary remarks.
First comes the distinction between what Gasar observed

for himself and what he learned from others. Of these latter,

bis chief informante were Gauls, and chief amongst the Gauls,
most probably, Divitiaous the AEduan. The parts of Ger· ’
many which an AEduan would best understand would be
those of the Middle Rhine—Hesse, Franoonia, and the
northern parts of Suabia. The name by which these Ger·
maus were known was Suari.

Another point to notice, is the likelihood of the Germans
thus described having spoken Gallio to the Gauls, instead of
the Gauls having learned German: inasmuch as there is the
special statement that Ariovistus spoke the language of the
country he had invaded; and that it was iu Gallie that he
made himself intelligible to the Romans. There is no evi·
dence of any Gaul speaking German.

Hence, it will not be surprising if many of the names iu
(iasar are as little German as the name Wslslr rs (lambrian
Without, at present, saying how far such rs the case, it is
enough to remark that, amongst the German populations of
cesar, there rs only one whereof the name is unequivocally
German, as tested by its structure and etymology. This
word is Marcomuaai=Marclemen‚ or mea os tre bouadurieo.

01 the Germana of Ariovistus, (laesar's knowledge was
personah bnt these were intrusive emigrauts rather thau
true Germana, ia, Gemens in a Gallie locality, and (proba-
blyfor that reason) partially Gallicised. The Germana for
the parts between Bonn aud Nimeguen, were also similarly
known.

Irastly, he speaks from his study of previous writers,
quoting Eratosthenes for the extent and name of the
Hercyniau forest.
