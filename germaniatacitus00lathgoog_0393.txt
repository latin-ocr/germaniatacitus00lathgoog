Zeuss compares this with the Norae rda=bpdpoe=roco
(the same word).

Againet it are-—

o. The utter absence of any such name applied to any
portion of the Norsemen, in any of the numerous Norsc
writinge.

d. Its present power, as the name of so large a country as
Bossia, withso few definite traces of Norse occupancy.

o. The name Rbocokcni, of a nation between the Don and
Dnieper.

The following view is considered ιο reconcile these diffi-
culties.

Provious to the descent on the Euxine and Caspium, the
Norsemen conquercd aud occupied the country of the Bloc-
lcnes, and, after they had become known ιο their neighbours
as Istos, harassed the eastern empire.

In being known to their neighbours hythe name of the

country they occupied, they were like the present Spaniards

Of'lllreemdliestion as ιο the stock ιο which those sochus
belonged, will bring with it a fact confirmatory of the pre-
vious view. Although we nowhere find that the Norscmen

iu question themseloee oclkd cometae Boe, the Finlanders at
the present moment call them Estote-alainen, and their country
Rooted.

This is a fact which has long been known. It has also
long been known that -beicen is the regular Fiulandic ter-
mination for gentile nouus. Such being the case, the word
Ῥωξολονοί hae long been looked on as a genuine Uprico
gloss; and as Strabo mentions the Rhoxolani, there must
have been, in his tinne, not only Ugrians in Russia, but
Ugriane so near the Euxine as for words of their tangue to
reach his informants.

Such Ι believe ιο have been the case. I think that there
were Ugrians as far south aa the Lower Danube. This con·
firma the notion that Russia was not originally Slavonic.*
Ιι also confirma the uotion that there were Ugrians in South
Europe before the Majiar invasion.
