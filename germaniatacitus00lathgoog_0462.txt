EPlLEGOMENA. cxxxv

Usipetes, or Usipia'; a population which, unless Ptolemy
mention it under the name Vupt he does not mention at all.

But Wis-haden is not too far south lor the most southern
Ust'pii. Perhaps not. We must remember‚ however, that
they raaeh as lar nortl as Holland‚ ia, the country of the
Taranta (Tweatbo).-Epikyomcno‚ ἕ ι.

§ nxrrr. run Νούσιπες.

The Νούσιπες (Novimus) of Strabo; known only as we
know the Laudi, sla, as memhers of the great Arminian con-
federacy‚ or, at least, as Germana, led in triumph for the
victory that avenged it.

Probably, Uannii, under another form3 especially as the
Usipit (as such) are not mentioned hy Strabo.

§cxiv vnn Χαῦὸοι, Κῖοιῖκοι,ί Καθύλκοι, Καμψιανοὶ,
μ ovo.

l. Against considering the Χαΰέοι as the Aoiooaof Tacitus,
there are uo great reasons. Neither are difficulties created,
by making it the name of a separate substantive population.

2, 3. The other names are more problematical.

Thus,-

Besides the Καθύλκοι and Καοῦλκοι, Strabo mentions the
Chauci, distinguishing between them and the latter. Still the
names are aliha—the more so when we lind Chaucos made
trisyllabic :-

·-- non indignante Chauco
Pascat Belga pecua-Claudiam De laud. Stilich.

Then there are the Olobilci of Gaul-See not. in Germania
omna.

4, 5. Καμψιανοί and Ἀμψανοί are names suspiciously
alike. Yet they both ocenr in the same writer-Strabo.

a. Are both, or either, Ampsivarii?

b. Are both, or either, the people of the parts about
Komptca in over-ijsell

c. Is one one, and the other the other!
