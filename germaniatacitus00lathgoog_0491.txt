Plutarch mentions that their war-eries were understood
and answered by the Ligariana. Now it is possible that the
Ligurians were Kelts, whilst it is certain that they were not

Goths.

Plo Teutones.-Appian speaks of the Teutones having in-
vaded Noricum, and this under the head Κέλτικα.

Florus calls ene of the hings of the Teutones Teutoboechus,
anama Keltic rather than Gothic.

Virgil has the following lines:-

—Late jem tum ditione premebat
Sarrastes populos, ct quae rigat oequora Sarnus ;
Quique Rufras, Batulumque tenent, atque arva Celennae3
Et quos maliferae despectant moenia Abellae:
Teutonico ritu soliti torquere cotciet.
Tegmina queis capitum raptus de subere cortex,
AErataeque micant peltas, nricat aereus ensis-AEn vii. tat-743.

Now this word catcie may bc a provincialism from the neigh-
bourhood of Sarrastc. It may also (amongst other things) be
a true Teutonie word. From what follows, it will appear
that this latter viewis at least as likely as any ether. The
commentatore state that it is eoo Celtico That this is true
may be seen from the following forms-Irish: pc, apocr,
jocalia· poelli, ditto, adom poti, a spect· (O'Reilly); pootlodd,
c junctim godi, spem,- poi, ditia· crona paida, spent·-
sleft (Begly)-00mish: pec, pcto, pu, goi=leaea apocr,
jecelia, slcft (Pryce)—Breton: goos, peoff (Rostremer).

Considering the peculiarities of the Keltic pronunciation,
this word calcio is perhaps the gesom of another part of
Virgil, and the ὑσσ-ός of Appian, as well astho English
word pond.

Pto Cimbri-Tic Taureae-Of either the Cimbri sepa·
rately, or ef the Cimbri and Teutones collectively, being of
Gallie origin, we have, in the way of direct evidence, the
testimonias exhibited above, eia, of Sallust, Oieero, (iasar,
Diodorus. To this may be added, that of Dion (lessius, who
not only had access to the contemporary accounts which
spelm of thom as Gauls, bnt also was enabled te use them
critically, being possessed of information concerning Germany
aa well as France.
