'Phose with the second caspirated (Cuncti, Κοῦχοι) occur in
Velleius Paterculus, Spartianus, Ptolcmy.

Dion (lessius has toth forms Χαῦκις and Κοῦχοι.

Lucan and claudian divide the vowels and make them trisyllabic.
This division of the vowelsis os some importancc in the history of
ethnological conjecture, since it brings the forms (logici and Outioi ιο
a resemblance with the Καοῡλκοι os Strabo, and then with the wicbold,

The Chauci fell into two divisione-the Chauci minem between
the Ems andWcser‚ the (lhauci majorca between the Wcser and lilhe.

lt is safe to identisy them with the Hoc-inpos of the Treveller's
Scng and Beowulf-the termination -s'nq being a patronymic, the
-cs the sign of the plural number, and the ch in Chauci equivalent
totin the same way that Ot=H in otius· and Hoste.

lt is safe, too, to consider the Chauci as members os the Frisian
section of the Gothic stoch.

In the battle cf Finnesburh, Hsoef, the eponymus of the Hono-
rio-iona, the son of Finn, the son of Folcwalda, has, as his queen,
Hildcburg, the Hoc-icy. I do not consider that this gives us any·
thing historical. All that it does is ιο connect the Chauci and
Frisii (Hoc-inps incursum) by certain political relations ,- and
carry the arsa oi their legendary localities as far as Hanover and ,
Hildesheim.

Considerable difficulties ere involved in the statement that the
chauci extended asfar as the frontier ol the Chatti 3 difficulties turn·
ing upon the relationship between the Old Saxcn and the Anglo-
Saxon longuages.

If we join the Chauci and Chatti, we do one of two things ; we
either-

s. Disconnect the country of the Old-Saxone of Westphalia from
that ol' the AngloSaxons: or else we-

h. Enclose two such importent populations as the Old Saxons and
AngloSaxons within too small an area.

Two other points connected with the ethnography of the Chauci
still stand over.

1. vhe discrepancy between 'l’acitus and Pliny as to their physical
and political condition. What Tacitus says may bc seen in the
text. It is much the some as Velleius Paterculus had said before :—
“Moeptae Cauchorum nationes 3 omnis eorum juventus, v'ofioita
sumno, immensa corporibus, situ locorum tutissima, traditis armis
.’ . ante imperatoris procubuit tribunab”
