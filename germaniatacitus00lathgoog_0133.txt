his absence, few important events occurred, except that the
Bructeri defeated the legate, M. Lollius, destroyed his legion,
and captured the standards. Alter the return of Tiberius,
he received the command in Gaul, to complete the subju-
gation of Germany3 he penetrated as far as the Elbo, aad
reduced the Sigambri, Bructeri, and Cherusci, to obedience.
Orr the Elbe, hc was joined hythe Roman flect, which had
been fitted out on the muer Erus, or had come from thc
Rhine to the Ems. How it got up tho Elbe cannot be ex-
plained; it may have gone up usfar as Magdeburg; and
yet the Roman galleys could not sail against the current,
like steam-boats. After this campaign, Tiberius lest Ger·
many, as his predecessore hed done, aud as many of his
successore did aster him; for the intention of the Romans
was merely to crush the Germana not to put themselves
in possession of their country, which they can hardly have
thought worth the trouble of occupyiog.

While the Germane, north of the Thiiringer Wald and

about the Ham Mountains, were thus visited by the Romans,
there existed iu Bohemia the great kingdom of Maroboduus,
who is estrange and mysterious phenomenon in the early
history of Germany. lt is expressly stated that he had
a large town (Roviasmum) for his capital, a regular army
of seventy thousand men, and four thousand horsemen‚ a
body-guard, and definite political institutions. Justus bldser
is perfectly right in saying that the Germane, ia the descrip-
tions of the Romans, must not be conceived of as more un-
civilized thau the modern peasants of Westphalia, or Lower
Saxony. Their dwelling-houses‚ one thousand eight hundred
years ago, were, I believe, not different from the more com-
mon ones in our own days, and the habitatione of their
ehiefs were the same as the buildings of the middle ages.
Tho notion that the ancient Germane were savages is com-
pletely false; they were neither more nor less than ancul-
tivated country-people, to whom lile in towns is altogether
unknown.

of the ruined magnificenee of her father’s empire, and the
brasc-covered palaees of her ancestors, the kiugs of Thtiringia.
