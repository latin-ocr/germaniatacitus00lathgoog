Who, however, lay ιο the east, and who to the north, is a

difficult questi0n; aud still more difficult is it ιο say who
amongst the northern group, were on the east, and who on
the west.

The Siqulooce of Ptolemy are the most decidedly north-
westem, cr Frisian3 the Varini of Tacitus, the most decidedly
eastern, or Slavonic. And this is as much as it is safe ιο say.

Ιι is more important ιο consider the reasons for believing
the populations to the north-west of the Anyti ιο have heen
Frieicu, rather than Angle, Saxon, or AugloSaxon. Why,
in the face of the fact of the Nordalbingians (or the popula-
tions worth cf tle Elbc)be1ng called Saxona* in the ninth
century, suppose them to have been Frisians in the second?

The answer to this is sketched in the preceding ξ.

If Anglc populations were the earliest occupante cf western
Holstein, when and how did the F risians displece them?

lf Frisians were the earliest, when did the Angles do sol

Now it must be admitted that there is some evidence in
favour of this latter alternative3 but evidence which is hy no
means conclusive.

Alfred writes (Orosius, p. 25), respecting Other, that
“He seglode to pacm porte pe man haet Hae'dum. Se stent

He also writes, “Gomon hi (ia, the English) of prim fol-
cum ham strangestan Germanice, hcet of Scaeam, and ol
