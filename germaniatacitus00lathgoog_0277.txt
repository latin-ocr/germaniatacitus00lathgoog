other-sy, there is the statement 11 Tacitus, thst the Chauci sud

Consideraticns 11 this kind justiiy us in beliering thet, when oer-

Hence, Ι believe 11111 when the Cherusci are spoken 11 in general
history, the Chamsvi and Angrivarii are included! in one 11 the two

German lengusgs, we may sufely say thet such was marty 1111 case.
If so, the Cherusci ere 11 111 111111 ethnclcgicsl importance with the
