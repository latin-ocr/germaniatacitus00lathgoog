isa word of Roman make; one which never has been deve·
loped in the country itself.

That it is foreign we know; and we know it because it
has been assigned within the memory of man. But what if
it had been assigned in the obscure days of the third and
fourth centuriesl It would undoubtedly have passed for
native.

At the same time Ι admit that, in order for one nation to
adopt the name by which it is known to another,·there
must be a very favourable combination of circumstancest
c. y.—

o. There must be a considerable difference in the power
of the two populations; the weaker taking the name from
the stronger only when the fact of its relative weakness
is evident.

d. Or there must be intermixture.

c. Or there must be more than one natiou to use the
foreign term, whilst only one upholds the native.

contrary to many, Ι am dissatisficd with the evidence which
makes two very important words native and German—
Saahe'o (Saevi) and Soron. I think each of these was di-
rectly Bacca, and remotely Keltic. Hence, to the objection
against their aea-Germanic character, founded upon their
undoubted adoption by undoubted German populations, l
suggest the fact that their adoption was favoured by the
support of two languages (the Roman and the Keltic) against
the German single-handed.

More specific reasons will be found in the sequel* At
present I merely illustrate a line of criticism.

'l'he etymology of national names is generally considered
a powerfnl instrument in ethnological research.

lt is doubtful, however, whether much hasbeen done by it.

ch writers admit any one's etymologies but their own.
This is a proof of the arbitrary method in which the practice
is carried out.
