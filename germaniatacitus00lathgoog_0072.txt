another, and so error gets guarded against.

In respect to its form, Marc-ommuni is one of the most
satisfactory words of antiquity.

It first appears in Oaesar's notice of the subjecte and
allies of Ariovistus. The fact of Oaesar's informants being

Gauls, and the greater part of his nomenclatme being Gallie,
isthe only difficulty that accompanies the notion of the
German being the language in which its meaning is to be
sought.

But this is only the shadow of a shede; inasmuch asthe
undoubtedly German authorities, iu which it afterwards
occurs, do away with ull doubt as to the tongue to which it
belongs.

Nevertheless, why this should be German, when Caesar's
other names are Gallie, ie not so easy to say.

Its formis full and perfect. There are the two elementa
which mehe it a compound (machmam) and the copula
(-o·) which connects them.

Mark=murcb‚ and mcoo=maw, so that Mare-omousi

From thie derivation I hau three points ot' great im·
portance in the practice of ethnological criticism, points
which, sofar as I am auare, have never been sufficiently

basis of so much inference as they will be in the following

Mare-emanat being numerous; as numerous as the number
