l. The Finlanders call the Germana Samon. This is
weighty.

On the other hand—

l. No clear distinction has ever been drawn between, ay„
an Angla of Suffolk and a docco cf Essem

2. Thc Romans, who knew, for some parts at least, every
inch of the land occupied by the Saxcns of Germany, as long
as there is reason for believing that they took their names
from German sources, never use the word Suam at all. It is
strange to Caesar, Strabo, Pliny, and Tacitus. (Sea note in
v. Cherusci). Ptolemy is the first who uses it.

3. Α native name by which the west-saxona cf Waoe
called themselves, was Gewissos. This is well accounted for
by supposing it to be a British name in a German mouth.

4. erenever we find a population called Scaea, we find
that, for some reason or other, it has some other name as well.
Thus the so-callcd-

a. Sancus of Holstein‚ are Nordatbioptcos when the name
is general: Ditmarsi, Hortari, and Stormarit when we have
them in detail.

b. Those of Northern Germany arc Wectploli, Ost-ptati,
and Aopcric'.

5. 0f all such synonyma, Sason is the least German in
respect to its form; a fact which precludes us from admitting
the existence of a second language, hut denying its applica-
tion to the word aaron. Thus, admitting that the words
belong to different languages, it cannot be said that of the
two-

a. uacca as opposed to Acyta is sammaa, and Asyla as
opposed to Sanco is acc-Germanic.

b. Nor yet can it be said of the most doubtful synonym of
the list, Cherusci ‚· since the -sc, whether Gerrnan or not, is
more German than anything in the form Saxon.

c. With such words as Nordalbingii, Weat-phali, and Ang-
arii (=carii), there is no doubt.

6. W hatever were the relations between the Angles and
Saxons, populations dc’ffmmly related were called Saxone.
Thus, the conquerors of the Slavonic country at present
called Saxony, the ancestors of the Saxons of Dresden and
