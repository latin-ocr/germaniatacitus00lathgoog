To verify the doctrine that the coincidences in the names of the
metals are as they are stated to be, a few considerable, but by no
means unreasonable, letter-changes are assumed. Thus—

1. AEs, aia, dr, ore and cir are the same words, the change from
s to r being verified by the oblique cases of the Latin langunge
itsell-Nom oes, Gen. cer-is.

2. The identification of the Slavonic root z-Lt with the Gothic
yid is also legitimate5 since the change from 9 or k to a sibilant
is usual-rapd·=beart=saird, in Lithuanic.

3. The Spanish hietro explains the loss of thef· in smum, as
compared with jera and iren.

Ocpper seems to be an exclusively German root 3 and copperis
the metal which, from being earliest worked, is earliest used.

In Gothic arcbaeology it is well known that the socelled mallio
· age is separated from the socalled catecwtollic by a broad line ef
demereation3 the series of lacte upon which the distinction reste
being as follows :-

a. ln certain graves, tumuli or barrows, the implemento lound

clusion of metal of any kind.

b. In others, they are of yoht or stoa, to the exclusion ol iron or
bronze.

c. In others, ol iroa or bronze ss well as the more precious metals.

The general doctrine is, that the third class of graves are the
aewest, the first the oldest ,· and, upon this doctrine, a considerable
number ol archaeological and ethnological genemlizations have been
’ founded 3 the civilization (or want of civilizatiou) of the period
anterior ,to the practice ol metallurgy being contrasted with that
which arose out of the introduction of that art. One of the more
important hypotheses connected with this distinction hes been so
