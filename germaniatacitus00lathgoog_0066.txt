of Genterbury, being Genterbury also. Nor yet any name
very similar to it, such as Caertcrlery, Kandara, hc.

Though this is an extreme case, it illustrates the points of
question-it being assumed, ot' course, that the similarity is
wholly accidental. lt Englishmen had been there previously,
thecuae would be different. The similarity would then be
other than accidental; and a connexion of some sort or other
between the district in which the settlement toolr place, and the
district from which the settlers originated would account for it.

No one imagines Boston in Massachusets to be anative
Iudien name. Yet why should it not be sol Not because
the combination was either impossible or improbable for an
Indien3 but because it is the name of a town in Eugland-
from whence some of the settlers came, or upon which they
had their eye. Such is the fact3 and it is a fact which
we should have been nearly as sure of, if the details of the
foundation ot' Boston of Massachnsets were unknown, as wc
are now.

The presence of Englishmen in the two Bostom would
have been conclusive; the chauces against a people con-
nected with one Boston falling in accidentally with another
Boeton ready-made (as it were) in respect to name, being
incalculably great.

But what if the Boston in Massachusets were the older
name of the twol Difficulties would arise. We could not
then derivo it from the Boston in Lincolnshire.

It is not necessary to carry this hypothetical illustration
further: mutatis mutandis, the argument which it involves
applies to the Galle aud the Geta.

a. The names are alihe: indeed by the later writers Geta
is used as equivalent to Gallie,⁸ and in Pliny we find Gauda
by the side of Gela.

ὂ. The supposed country of the Galle is Germany: the
undoubted country of the Gela is the Lower Danube.

e. Of the two names that of the Geta is the older.

In this case we really have the difficulty so lately indicated.
Emigrents‚ with the name Gothi, leave Germany3 and, ot'
all the countries in the world, settle in one belonging to a
pcople with a name soliha their own as that ot' the Gela acci-
