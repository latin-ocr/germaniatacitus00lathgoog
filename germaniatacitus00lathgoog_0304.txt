³ 0si.]—No other writer but 'l'acitus umqeieocully mentions suy
tribe with aname like that of Osi, in the neighbourhood cf the
south-eastern March. she Osie' os Ptolemy are too far north to
coincide with them. These are a people beyond the velte (Obilrur),
ahithusnic netion on the Baltio—Ildlw δὲ τὴν μὲν ἐφεξῆς τῷ
Οὺενεδικῷ κόλπῳ παρωκεανῖτιν κατέχουσιν Οὒέλται, ὑπὲρ obe Ὅσιοι,
εἶτα Κάρέωνες ‹immores-023 a people whose name Zeuss is probably
right in connecting with that of the island Ouilia=0ezel.-P. 272.

Ι say that no writer but Tacitus umquicocolly mentions any tribe
with a neme like that of the Osi, in the neighbourhood of the south·
eastern March 3 and I now draw attention to the qualifying word
empericocolly. What if the Οὑϊσξούργιοι be the people of otu-
ἔονργ-, as they almost certainly were, and Οὐῖσξοοργ- he the burg or
berg of the Osil

Whether the -fiovpy- ln Οὑῖσέούργιοιεὸενρεὴᾶὶ, cr burgh:
boroeyb, te, whether the compound be a word like Konings·ber9‚ or
aword like Ham-bury, is of no great consequence. The word isa
German one. Yet it by uo means follows thet the uation it desig·
nated wes German.

Wisbury (cr Wisberg) might be a German name for a Slavonio
locality‚ just as Lieflcnd (licensis) and Ooorloud are.

It might also (ae suggested in p. 97), in the hands cf a Greek
writer, take the form Asciburgius Mona.

That the Ori were oet German is Tacitus’s own statement.

The complement to thie note is not. in vv. Arocstcs' ab Osis—Osi
ob Araviscis, p. 96, dre.

The hypothesis is as follows :-

α. That the populatiou from the amtorem Moru, cr the Gorpa·
thiens between Gallicis, moravia, and Upper Hungary, was once
continuous with that of Oroatia ; the northern portion cf it being
called, by the Germsns, Ori.

b. The invasion of the Germans cs the Danube broke up this
continuity.

c. But not wholly. Within the German area (probably in the
mountain strongholds of the lucc Silva=Jablaeka Bery), isolated
porticus of the Osi preserved their lengsmge.

⁴ marcq-what applies to the Marsigni applies tc the Burie'.
They may be considered German as long as there is no stronger
objection lying agsinst them than their situation beyond the March,
