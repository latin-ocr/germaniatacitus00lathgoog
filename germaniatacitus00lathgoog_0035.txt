knowledge of contemporary witnesses, the first question which
we ask is the extent to which our new knowledge conlirms or
invalidates our previous accounts. lt may do either one or

Thot they are more or less Slavonic in the present century,
hasbeen shown already; but thot they were so as early as
the ninth‚ eighth, and seventh centuries, is a fact not
sufficieutly appreciated.
