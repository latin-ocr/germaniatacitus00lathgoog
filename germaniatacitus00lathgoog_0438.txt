This placeo them iu the purte about the Elhe.

Pwlemy] names, I imagine, are, like the maa-² of Em»
und Chaa-uarii, names of one and the same people.

Hence, it seems nte te mett—that there were raam on
the Luwer Elhe, near enough tu the Germane to hove a Ger-
man compend, u their name—Teuton-ariu'.—-— Tuncrum-ware.

Whether they were Germana in another question. They
may huve been Germane of the Germano-Slavunie March in
Luuehnrg, or Mecklenhurg.

Iu the history of ethnological opinion these Teutones have n
prominent place, They cannot but have been identified with

The root V-ly=psople in Latin (only—u), yet no ono gives
this an n reason for making the 3⁶19-ae Emmaus⁴

1⁷41, too, does the nanno in Gema». But is this u reason
for mapping-up every naaion whose nume io Volant, Balffae,
or something like it, uz German! If so, the Volcae Tecto-
sages would be Germana.

Why, then, opply a rnle to the root T4=peoph which we
apply to no other eombinntion of sounde with a nimilnr power!
Because, the impounbility olluded to hos never been truly
