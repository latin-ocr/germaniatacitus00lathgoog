tlre middle of the third century* to the present day, the root
Such, or Saea, has been a notive German name for the
Germane of Suedio. Before this, we hear of Saevi, but their

locality is actitandis. ’

What does this prove? That Saco- was a German name
previously? By no means. It merely proves that a certain
area was called by the Romans atter a populatiou named
Saevi, end that certain Germane who settled there took their
name from the area. Kent, at the present moment, is English,
and the Keat-iays who occupied part of it during the Angla-
Saxon period were English. But does this malm Kent an
English werdt Ne. It is British= Cant-inm, as is well-known.

Up to tlte tirno ia question (ia, the reign of Alexander),
the known facts are quite as much against Saea· being a
German root as in favour of it. Gaesar's Saevi are described
by Goals, aud Tacitns's are in a locality which at one aud the
same time is· different from Caesar's, and Sloooat'e. No ene,
who lras realized the ext-ent to which national names vary
with tlre language of the informante, will say that the root
Sace, as applied to the subjecte ot Ariovistus, may net be
as aeolosiocly Gallie, as the word Welslt is ecelaaoely
Germanic.

Hence, up to the time in question, Seruio is simply the
name of the country ofa populatien that the Romans and
Kelts called ›5on populatiou which need not even be
Germanic, still less, necessarily, call themselves by Saea.

* This is allowing the tenu Saevos, os applied to certain populations end
individunls (eg, Ricimer) hythe Latin writers, an excessive extension. The
same authors would have called Hengist, had such a personage been in Rome,
a Britoa. Yet he was no such thing. Such a Characem, too, us the bre-
ther of Arminius, would also heve been called Ger-racana. Yet such a name
was strange to the individua] himself. Similarly, Englishmen call Prinee
Albert a German, ond (perhaps) in speaking English he calls himself so.
Yet he is a Dentatis. These remarks are necessary, since the render cannot
too clearly see that the question is not whether certain Saevi were sermons,
but whether such Germane called themselves Sorai. However‚ es the argu-
ment is put in its strougest form, the objeetieu isnot pressed: otherwise
the truly unexccpticuable evidence of Saea- heing a German root, begins
when the Germane of Suebis, uneqnivoeally speaking of themselves, in their
own languuge call themselves Sueten. This is much later.
