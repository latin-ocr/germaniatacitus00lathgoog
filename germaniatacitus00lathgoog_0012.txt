point of view their value as authorities.

In one respect Ι may appear to have understated
the case that can be made out by the advocates of
what may be called the German theory iu its broadest
form. One of the strong arms of their argument is,
the etymological deductiori of names like Saevi, typri,

these derivations may be found incidentally through-
out the work. In the eyes of such readers as they
satisfy‚ I have done less than justice ιο the views of
their devisers. But, if the samples* in question be *J
(as they are believed ιο be) fair specimens of the j

will lay me open to the charge of keeping back any
very valid arguments on the opposite side.

It should be added that the order in which
the different geographical and national names of the
Epilcpomcuu are taken is what may be called lopicrrl,
i.e., those populations which illustrate each other, and
which are subject ιο the same lines of criticum, are

grouped together, sometimes (but not often) to the
violation of geographical proximity‚ and ethnological
