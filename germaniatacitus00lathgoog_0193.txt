From the great importance of Woden in all the Gothic mythohgies
wherein he appears, and from the extent to which he appears in all
that are at all known, it is likely that Wodew was Tacitus's Mercury.

With Matthew of westminster, and Geoffrey of Monmcuth this
was certainly the view—“ Colimus maxime Mercurium, quem Woden
lingub nostrt appellamus.” 'l'his is, probably, from Tacitus.

As both writers, however, ,lived subsequently to the name of
Wedneaday being given to the fourth day of the week, they scarcely
pass for independent evidence.

“Who invented lettersl” is one of the questions in the Anglc·

A metrioal homily (all this is from Mt. Kemble) says :-
