Lithuunic must be explained by either u migmtinn, or nn
original coutinuity os areu.

The presumptione have been dehemined. Let us now
eho->se between these alternativesi

The Indo-Eumpesn populatum umy have been continued
frum Asia into Europe (or vice varod) by two lines—

1. One tn the nortla—

2. One to the routh of the Ompiau Sea.

The difficulties, esch way, are the same iu amount, though
different iu kind.

l. On the north we have the vast trsets of Iudependent
Tartary. the water-systems of the Lower Jaik and Volgu,
iu which the Indo-Europen population which, by assump-
tion. was coutinuous from-the Oxus to the Dnieper‚ has
wholly disappeared. Now the more we go back the wider
this interval hammes: since. the Russians, at the beginning
of the historica! period were further from ludin thau they ure
now. The supposed displseement, then, iu this quarter rnust
have been euormous. The further objections that nrise out of
the distribution of the existing Turk und Ugrinu ssmilies of
the ures in question (a distribution which makes it almost
impossible for un Indo-Europen populatum ever w have
been ou the north οἲ the Caspiana), are too numerous for s
work like the present,

2. A prolongution of the Indo-Europam area in the
directior· of Asin, and to the south of the Csspiun, is, at the
first viem pmeticable enough. And here the remark that
whatever brings Litkuauia naam to India diminislm diffi-
culties, has its bearing. Lot the Getae be Lithuunians, the
Thraciam may be Lithunnic also, since more than one good
authority of autiquity identifies the two. Then the Bithy·
niaus were Thracam—which brings the Europenn Lithuanie
half-way, or more, to meet the Indo-Europen dialects of
Wentern Persia. Be it so. The Armenian lauguage is a
stumbling-block. lt ought, from its geugmphy, to be inter-
mediste to the Sanskrit and Limnaia—whereas, that it
is Indo-Europum at all is more thau many good judges
allow it to be. At any rate, it is not what it ought to he
for the hypothesis—transitivum! in character.
