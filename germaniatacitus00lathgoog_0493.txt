Undoubtedly the pronunciation here ridiculed is that of

the Gauls, and it is just possible, that in it is loreshadowed
the curtailed form that the Latin tongue in general puts on in
the French. Again, the slave whose eourage failed him when
ordered to slay Gaius Marius, is called both a Gaul and a
Cimbrian by Plutarch, as wellas by Lucan. In the latter
writer, we have probably but apiece of rhetoric—Pharsalia,
libii.
, Amongst tribes undoubtedly Gallie, the Nervii claimed de-
scent from the Teutones and Cimbri. The passage of Tacitus
that connects the Nervii with the Germana, connects them also
with the Treviri. Now a well-known passage in St. Jerome
tells us that the Treviri were Gauls:- Νέρὲιοι ἦσαν δὲ
Κίμέρων καὶ Τευτόνων ‹ludwice-Appiam iv. l, 4. “ Tre-
viri ct Nervii circa affectationem Germanicae originis ultro
ambitiosi sunt, tamquam per banc gloriam sanguinis, a
similitudine et inertia Gallomm separentur.''-German. 28.
Finally, in the Life of Marius by Plutarch, we heve dialogues
between the Cimbri and the Romans. Now a Gallic inter-
preter waa probablc, but not soa German one.

Such are the notices bearing upon the ethnography of the
Gimbri. Others occur, especially amongst the poets; of
these, little or no use can be made, for areason indicated
above. J ustin speaks of embassies between Mithridates and
the Gimbri. Suetonius connects the Gimbri with the Gallie
Senones; he is vvriting, however, about Germany‚ so that his
evidence, slight as it is, is neutralized. Theories grounded
upon the national name may be raised on both sides 3 Cimbri
may coincidc with either the Germanic kempc=a warrior or
atemptare, or with the Keltic Oymrp=0amdriaaa Equally
equivocal seem the arguments drawn from the descriptions
either of their physical conformation or their manners. The
silence of the Gothic traditione as to the Gimbri being Ger-
manic, proves more in the way of negative evidence than the
