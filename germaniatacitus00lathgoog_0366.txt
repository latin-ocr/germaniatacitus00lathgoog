traced bigher than the reign of Caracalla; and (a fact of
primary importance) tdey sorra idea ia tto couatry of tto
Geta. So they were when Decius and Claudius fought
against them; so they were when, pressed by the Huns,
they besougbt Valens to allow them to pass the Danube; so
they were when Hermanric's kingdom was consolidated,
and so they were until they invaded Macedonia, Illyri·
cum, Grecos, Italy, Southem Gaul, F rauce aud Spain. Of
all the Gothic families their migratione were the most consi·
derable.

It was a long one that took them from Germany to the
country of the Getae. lt was a longer one which carried
them from the country of the Getae to Spain.

Of all the Gothic tribes the Goths Proper have most

merged their nationality in that of the countries which they
invaded. ln Greece, in Italy, in Southern Gaul, and in
Spain, no Goths are to be found as a separate substantive
people; and no known dialect definitely aad unequivocally
representa the old Maso-Gothic. On the Lower Danube
itself‚ the Goths of the Grimea, now no longer distinguished
by their German tongue‚ and, consequently, no longer easily
distinguishable from their neighbours‚ are their sole represen-
tatives -if such they can now be called. In Germany itself‚
the mother-country, from which evenat the beginning of their
history they were already separated, the Thuringian dialect is
supposed to be the most Gothim but this—a statement made
by Michaelis-has yet to be definitely confirmed.
Ι But the history cf the Ostro-Goths and Vici-Goths, is no
history of all the populations whose name was G-t, Μ,
or some similar form. Hence arises the long series of ques-
tionsgs to whether each population, thus connected in name,
were connected in other attributes als03 ia, whether they
were really Goths, or only populations with a nominal resem-
blance.

Ι. Isthere any connection between the Gotdoaes and Go-
ttici? Three points connect them.

l. The similarity of names—Gotdioi as compared with
Gotdoaas.

2. The fact that they each differ from the Slavouiaus oi
