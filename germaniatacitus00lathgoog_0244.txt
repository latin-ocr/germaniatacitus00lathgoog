Now what if thie division os the Oroatians be as old ae tha tinio os
Tacitusl and what is the Germana translated the name in early times,
even as the 'I’urks did afterwards? In this case the name Oss‘ repre·
sente the German Weiss: While, and the Osi are the While Orestinus
under their German name, and Wieberg (Οιϊσιοάργιοι of Ptolemy)
it While-hill (or loten), and ewen the mysterious Ast-iburylus Mons
is Weiss-berg.

No objections against this lie in the current notion that the sla
venians ol the Danube did not make their appearance in history till
the sixth century—the notion itself being not only objectionable,
but almost certainly inoorreot. All that we fairly get frons the evi·
denos os Prooopius and others is, that it was the sixth century when
the populations of the Lower Danube beoarsn known as Stenostoma,-
just aa is was the third when the Westphalian and Hanoverian
Germana λοοιιαο known as Sasona, or those of tha Lower Rhine as
Franks, and just as three populations out of four throughout the
world are known at different periods of their history by different
names. The reasonable suggestion os Zenss that the Aravisci
are the population os the Raab, is a real complication. So is
the name of tha river Cusus in the probabla territory os the
oe:

une complement to this note is not. in v. oa· in the sequel.

'lbat Os= Weie is, perhaps, by slsels, unlikely.

'lhat Arooiso :Hhoroeitsle is also, perhaps, by itself, unlilrely.

But that a partos the Aravisci called Osi, should = Weiase ΗΙιοια·
eade is ιιοι unlikely-the eridenoe being ol tha sort ealled camala-
εισι, where two small probabilities make one great one.
