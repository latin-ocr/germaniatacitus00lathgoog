Such is the current reading in Strabo, who makes uo meu·
tion of the Lange-dardi.

See note iu v. Lange-dardi.

The word is eompouud, aud why should there not have
been three separate substantive natious with names com·
pouuded of—

l. The root t-rd ÷a prefix,

2. The root lory ψ an affin—niz. :—

1. Longu-odardi, or the men with either lony haurds or louy
kollerte-

Ξ. Loooodordi, or the meu with beardo (or lothero) en·
dowed with some quality expressed by teo-

3. Longo-surges, or the meu whose sarlco (whatever they
were) were long?

All sueh forms exist3 certainly in good authors, possibly
iu good MSS.

Thon there are,-

4. The Herebo-barm of tlre Traveller’s Soug, aud,-

5. The Barda of the Slavonie Bardorewie.

lhave no decided opinion here. It is my impression‚
however (aud I imagine that the eommou sense view of
the question coincides with it), that the Langobardi, Laoco-
tardi, and Lonyoeoryi are one aud the ¹saure population.

The truth ie, that geographioal texts require avery peculiar
kind of eritioism.

a. We eaunot prefer oue reading to another, because it will
give us certain results ς since that (iu many cases) is arguiug
iu a circle, ia, inserting the reading from the result, aud the
result from the reading.

ὂ. We cannot, as in other cases, argue from the context;
since the question is oue of lettere rather thau of words,-
auda proper name, in many cases, ean> as little be eol·
leoted from the words which accompauy itas the unmean-
ing eombinations which form a ohorus ean from the words
of a song.

The chief prelimiuaries to this eritioism are clear notions
