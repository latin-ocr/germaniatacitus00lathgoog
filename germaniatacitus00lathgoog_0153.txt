Does it exclude all Gauls, Rhoetiam, Pannonians, Sarmatiam and
Dacians from Germany, or does it exclude all Germans from Gaul,

Both questions require investigation-

That there were aosaGessnoat'e populations within the Germania
01 Tacitus, probably consisting 01 (100010, and certainly consisting 01
slavoniam, Lithuanians‚ and Finns, is one 01 110 main theorema 01
110 present volume ; 0 theorem 100 which the reasons rnay be found
in notes 00 well as in the preliminary observatione.

The complementary question as 10 absence 00 presence 01 German

³ Gallsh.]-Here the question arises as 10 whether the Goats formed
what may bs called an 011ποί091001 uaity: ts, first, whether the whole

Such are the general answers to the praerat question. The parti-

'llhat there were some Germane in Gaul is undoubted. We can
