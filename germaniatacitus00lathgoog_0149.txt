N either is it the name by which a Frenchman deignates Gemncwy.
Ile calls it Allenrapne.

Whence the differente? The different languages take the dis·
serent names for one and the same country from different sources.

The German term Deutsclt is an adjectioe; the earlier form of the
word being diatwc. Here the -isc is the same as the aab in words
like aelf-ish. Dicat, on the other hand, means peopl0,.or action
Hence, diat-isc is to diat, as popularis is to populus. This adjective
was first applied to the lunyuayc; and served to distinguish the
popular, natiowol, active, or wulgar tongue of the populations to
which it belonged from the Latin. It first appears in documents 01
the ninth century, “Ut quilibet episcopus homilias apertd trans·
ferre studeat in rusticam Romanam linguam aut theotiscam, quo
tandem cuncti possint intelligere quae dicantur.’‘-Synodus Tu·
ronensis, mn. 813.

As to the different forms in which either the root or the adjective
appears, the most important 01 them are as follows :-

1. In Moeso-Gothic, piccuto = §Ouerbe—Galatiam ii. 14; a
form which implies the substantive Ρῖπιᾶαεὲθνος.

2. In Old High German, diot=populaa, gives the adjective dioc
bc=popataric

3. In AngloSaxon we havc perid and pcddiac.

Sometimes this adjective means Malata· in which case it applies
to religion and is opposed to Christian.

Oitener it means intellig-ibic, or oernaoalrr, and applies to lan-
guage,¹ in which osse it is opposed to Latin.

ute particular Gothic dialect to which it was first applied, was
the German of the Middle Rhine. Here the forms are various :-
tbeoda‘scc, thiudisca, theudisca, teadhca, mathca. When we reach
parts less in contact with the Latin language 01 Rome, its uso is
rarer. llven the Germana oi the Rhine frequently use the equi·
valent term Alcamenis, and Francio,· whilst the Saxons and*
Scandinavians never seem to have recognized the word at all.

Hence it is only the Germans 01 Gmnoay that are Theotrbci, or
Desa-acha

We 01 England, on the other hand, apply it only to the Dutch 01
Holland.

Hitherto the term is, toa certain degree, one 01 disparagement 3
meaning con-Rama, or wulgar. It soon, however, changes its
character ; and in an Old High German gloss—armodiuti (capidem)
