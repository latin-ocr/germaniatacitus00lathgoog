mere agria illaborare domibus, suas alienasque for-
tunas spe metuque versare. Securi adversim homines,
securi adversus deos, rem difficillimam adsecuti sunt,
ut illis ne voto quidem opus esset. Cetera jam fa-

¹ Peucini—Bastarnas]-The Bastarnae took apromincnt part in
the uars os Philip, the father ol' Perseus, against the Romans.
Persuaded to become his allisa, they crosa the Danube, Cotto, one of
their nobles, being sent forward as ambassador. It was part of
Philip’s plan bo place the Bastarnae in the country os thc Dardani,
so that this latter nation (infutissimc Macedonica) might be destroyed
by them, and then “Bostcmzoe, relatis ic Dardania conjugibus lide·v
risque, cd populandum Italiam mitterentur.” ι

'l'hey enter Thrace, the Thracians retire to Mount Donusa. Here
the Bastarnae divide. Thirty thousand reach Dardania. The rest
crosa the Danube homewards. All this took place in the year of
the death oi Philip-Livy, xl. 57, 58. p

Strabo's evidence is remarkable ι-Ἐν δὲ τῇ μεσογαίᾳ Βοσεάμναι
μὲν τοῖς Τνριγέταις ὅμοροι καὶ Γερμανοῖς, σχεδόν τι καὶ uhrol τοῦ
Γερμανικοῦ γένους ὄντες, εἰς πλείω aihu διῃρημένοι. - Kal γὰρ

Ἀεμονοι λέγονταί τινες, καὶ Σιδόνες, oi δὲ τὴν Πεΰκην κατασχόντες,

τὴν ἓν τῷ Ἴστρῳ νῆσον, Πινκινοί.

This seems the evidence upon which they are made German:
Pliny having done so before, “Germanorum genera quinque—
Quinta pars Peucini, Bastarna . . contermini Dacis.”-H. N. ir. 14.

This has given thc Bastarnae great prominence in ethnology;
since they hare the credit of being the first Germana mentioned by
name in history.

Again-if the Basternae be German, the likelihood of the Geta
being so ia increased; and the two supposed facts reflect probability
on each other. (lomplications os this sort are os continual occurrence
in ethnology.
