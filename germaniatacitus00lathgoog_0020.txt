Tun basis of all othnological reasoning is the oxisting stato
of things* This wa taho as wo find it, and by arguing
baokwards from effect to consacraverat the carly history
of tho different divisions of tho human specics.

At the present moment tho distribution of tha Germanic
nations is very different from what it was in the fourth and
uon centurion in tha fourth and fifth centurion it was dif-
ferent from what it was in the tima of Tacitus3 and iu the

. ι time of Tacitus it was probably different from what it was
at tho beginning of tho historical era. Earlier still, it was
probably different again. .

Tha praeeat distribution of tho familias and nations dc-
sooudod from, or allied to, tha Germano of Tacitus extends as
far oastward as Austraiia, aud as far westward as North
Amerioa; as far north as Finmark, and as far south as Now

Zoalund.

ὓ Itis almost necessary to state that this characteristic of othnological
science is taken from Dr. thwell’s “Philosophy ot tha inductiva
&ieneesff’
