In doayiop the name (ι’-ί to he native to the Goth-iai,

Iassume that there is uo special evidence iu favour of its
being so; and such 1 believe to be the case.

Iu offireniap the same name to be native to tho Goth-onos,
Iam prepared with evidence.

Is the name which in Tacitus takes the form dcem
native or foreign? known to the tribes to which it applica or
as strange to them as the term Wolah is to Gambrianl This
is not answered in the reasouing upon the word AEstii ‚·
since it by no means follows that because one out of two
names given to a country is undoubtedly foreign, the other
is necessarily indigenous· The fact of the term Gothoaea
being indigenous is not a legitimate inference from tho exotic
character of the name AEsti-i. Just as the latter designation
was German, the former may have been Slavonic; and tho
one may have been as unlike the real native name as the
other.

Praetorius, a Polo, writing am. 1688, iu his Orbis Gothicus,
devotes two sections to the following questions :-

“ An reliquiae nominis Gothici in torris Europeae Sarmatiae
reperiantur?

‘⁶ Unde nominis Gadda contemptus hodie in Prussia 3''

From these we learn that the Samogitians, Bassiana
Lithuanians, Prussiaus, Zalavonians, Nadravians‚ Natravians,
Sudovians, Mazoviaus, and the inhabitants of Ducal Prussia
were called Gonnons by the people about Koningsberg, and
that this name was a noma of οοοίογηρι, acconnted for by the
extent to which tho populations to which it applied, had
retained their paganism against the efforts of the propagatore
of the Prussian Christianity. “ Gaddarum infidelium nomen
existit, adeo ut Gothus sive Gaddas idem iis qui paganus et
ethnicus, hostisque Christianitatis audierit.''÷'‘

That it was also Slavonic is showu by a line from an old

Tshckh (Bohemian) poem.

Gotatpja krasuyja dieuy na brezje sincmu morju.
Gon-ish sair maidens on harrk of (the) bluo scu.

Iu order to appreciate the full impert of the priorious state-
