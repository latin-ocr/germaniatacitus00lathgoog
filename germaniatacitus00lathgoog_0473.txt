Another remark of Niebuhr's upon St. J erome's statemen
is exceptionable He considers that the supposed German ι
Phrygia was introduced by tbe Goths of tha reign of Theo
dosius. Now their langnage would be MoesoGothic3 α
ease, as different from the German of the Lower Bhine, th
only German likely to be spoken at Treves‚ as the presen
Dutch is from the High German of Switzerland and Bavari
This difference is that of two mutually unintelligible tongues.

The supposed descent of the Nervii from the Teutones an
Cimbri, complicated as it is by the similar claim on the pa
of the Aduatiei (see not. in v. Nervii) is available only in th
hands of a writer who can throw any light over thadee
gloom that invests the history of those famous warriors.

Still, there is the evidence of Tacitus to their being le
Gallio, and more German thau the typioal Gauls.

This evidence we shall find is a reproduction of that ο
Oaesar-for which see Prolepomeam p. lxxii—where th
two chief texts are marked in ltalios, Belgae esee ortos n
Germanis, and Paemonos qui uno nomiae Germani appellante

To this-as an argument the same way—we may add t
present existence of the Flemish language in Belgium su
jeot to the certainty of Flanders having been conquered
the Franks iu the time of Olovis, and the likelihood of the
language having been then (and uo earlier) introduced.

Such is the evidence on one side. Agaiust it must ·

But this is, perhaps, neutralized by the fact of his treati
the Aquitanians who belonged to the Iberie stook, iu a simil
manner, ie, as Gauls.

The presence of Belgae in Britain, is also in favour of t
Belgae being Gauls; since the evidence of Gennaes on t.
other side of the Obannel, in the time of Caesar, is eminent
imperfectio, the legitimate evidence. Of course, by meki
