of classes. We may even admit the consideration of certain
external circumstances, such as literary development, aud
political separation. This makes the arrangement more or ,
less artificial. .

Be this, however, as it may, the following is a classi·
ficatiou of the kind in question.

o. The Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian dialects (written
aud unwritteu), the Faroio and the Icelaudic, form the
Scandinaviau brauch of the Gothic stock.

d. The Frisian, Old-Saron, Anglo-Saxon, English, Low-
land Scotch, Dutch of Hollend, Platt·Deutsch, and High
German, form the Teutonic brauch of the same.

Of course these again fall into subdivisione, according to
the date ol' the specimen, cg, there is the Old Frisian,
Middle Frisian, aud New Frisian; Semi-Sason, Old English,
Middle English, and Modern English; the Moeso-Gothic,
Alemannic, &c

The disadvantage of this method is that, in attempting
to draw definite lines of demarcatiou between the different
divisious, it disturbs the history of the lauguages, and dis·
guises the order of their evolution. Thus the Frisian, a
member of the Teutonic branch, is undoubtedly more like ·
certain Scandinaviau dialects thau it is to the more extreme
members of its own division.

Such being the case, a fresh view is required, and this is
best given by placing the tongues in a linear series according
to their affinities, and treating them as if (as is really the
case) they passed into each other by insensible degrees.

Hence, the more convenient, as well as the more natural
series, is that of the first chapter, viz.

l. Norse. 2. Frisiau. 3. Old Saxon. 4. Anglo-Saxon.
5, 6. Platt-Deutsch and the Dutch ol Holland. 7. High
German. 8. Moeso-Gothic.

The general characteristica of these divisione and subdivi-
sious of the Gothic tongues, in respect to the differences -of
their systems of elementary souuds, their grammatical struc-
ture, and their vocabularies, are in the department of philology.
One or two isolated points, however, have a practical bearing
upon certain ethnological details. ’
