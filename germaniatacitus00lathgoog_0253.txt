say that Herse came from Chatti is like saying that wmser came from
rectem the truth being that the one was the Biyt, the other the
Low German form.

Admitting this, we gain something more than aberren fact. We
infer that, in the particular case of the Chatti, at least, the authori·
ties of Tacitus were Low Germans3 a view confirmed not only by
the a priori probabilities of the case, but by several other similar
points of intereat evidence.

That the Chatti of Tacitus arethe Suevi of Caesar, is grounded
upon the—

ο. Absence oi the name cessi in the Bellum Gallicam: though
they were the people most immediately in contact with Gaul.

b. The history os the war with Ariovistus

c. The magnitude of the two populations 3 each requiring ιοο
large an area to be in juxtaposition with one another within the

d. The absence of the evidence os any considerable movemente in
the way of conquest or migration between the times os Gaesar and
Strabo, this latter writer mentioning the Chatti.

Grimm, who, as a Hessian, has entered upon the minute ethnology
os his native country cors amore, has added to these reasons, and «
found confirmations of their identity in the local legende os Hesse.
No reader acquainted with the vitality of old bys-words, and with
the metamorphoses of popular etories, will think the following points
of evidence unworthy of record.

a. Let the word Chatti, originally Low German, but now Roman,
give rise to a nickname (Setimpfwort), applicable ιο the Enim.

the root of rotatim Let such a name apply ιο both the Hesaians
and the Suabians. As sar ae this goes, it goes towards the connec-
tion of the two by meane of the common name Osci.

Now a niclrname (Solimpfwort) of the Hessians is Haud-Hersen or
Doy IIeasiarrs (Hoawd Hesriows): and a nickname (Scbimpfwcrt) os
the Suabians is blinda Scbwnb=or bliaad Suebiae-even as puppies
are blind at birth.

Everything in ethnology is a conflict of difficulties ; and it

must not be concealed that a grave objection lies against the
identification of the Chatti and Sucvi, in the fact that with the
ancient writers subsequent to Caesar, there is a mention os the Saevi
