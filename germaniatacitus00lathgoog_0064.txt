For the particular colony of the Warssci, see note in o.
Narisci.

Iu the sams neighbourhood (aa, on the Doubs) werc
several pagi of—

a. The Commooi, Amani, taking as a later form, the name
pegus Amatores, Emoas, aud Amaaseasis—

b. The Attuarii, Attuarii, Hutaorii, or Hatoan'i.

There cen be little doubt but that these were Chamavi
and Chattuarii removed from their original localities.

The detail of such colonies is a point of minute ethnology.
They are mentioued bere, however, for the sake of showing
that the presence of certain populations iu certain localities,
is to be taken with cantion. They may exist without the
parts about them being similarly occupied. Iu which case
the population is sporadic.

Now, iu order to constitute a true ethnologicul area, a
populatiou must not be isolated, uncouuected, or sporudic, but
continemus.

The Germauy of Tacitus extends from the Rhine to the
parts about the umber-country of Oourland on the north, and
as far as Gallicis on the south: to each of which countries
we heve special allusione.

For the intermediate portion of Europe, the frontier is
carried at least as far as the most eastern os these points3 aud
possibly further-possibly farther, because the central uation
of the Lyyii, whose country coincides with the modern king-
dom of Poland, is described as a large one.

With these limits it includes Mechlenburg‚ Brandcnburg,
Pomeranie, East aud West Prussia, Saxouy, Silesia, Bohonria,
aud Polaud.

By the Gornsooy of Tacitus, l mean Tacitus according to
the usual interpretation ; without either affirming or denying
that bis text requires this extent of country to vorify it.
