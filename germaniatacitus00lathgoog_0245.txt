⁷ Treviri]-'l'he lower third ol the Μ may be taken as tho
area ol the 'l'reviri3 extending (there or thereabouts) from Treves
(Asparata Trevirorum) to Cobleuta (Confluentes).

The chief nations with which they were conterminous on the
side of Gaul were the Condrusi, Eburones, and Remi—all Belgae.

'l'he Treviri, like the Tencteri, were pre-eminently strong in
cavalry—Caesar, BellGall ii. 24, v. 3.

They were also but slowly conquered -“ 'lreviri liberi ante& dio.
—Plin iv. l'l.

The name Treviri is most probably Gallio. 'the Tre, is the Tre
in such words as Tre-cosses in ancient Gaul, and Peeyoaell in (lorn-
wall 3 the Keltic tre=place‚ a root exceedingly common in Keltio
geographical terms. The constitution was Galla, the Condrusi and
Eburones being cicentes ol the Treuiri

The language ol the Tre-uiri is important

In most cases it would be hypercritioal to suppose that thera
was any differenoe between the language of tho town of Tretos and
the language of the Treuiri In the present question, however, itis
not so. The area under consideration is the area of cithera mixed
population‚ or the area of mixed ethnologioal characteristica—at
least, such is the language of both Caesar and Tacitus. Hence, the
dialect of the country and the dialect of the town may differ. All,
then, that can be said is, that a statement as to the language of the
town of Treves probably applies to that os the Treviri, and vioe msa
-probably, but not certainly.

Now St. J erome has the following passage (Prolegomen. lib. ii. ad
Epist. ad Galat.)-“ Unum est quod inferimus et promissum in
exordio reddimus, (laotos excepto sermone Graeco, quo omnis Oriens
loquitur, propriam linguam eandem pene habere quam Treuiri, nec
referre si aliqua exinde corruperint; quum et Afri Phoenicum lin-
guam nonnulla ex parte mutaverint 3 etipsa Latinitas et regionibus
quotidie mutetur et tempore.'’

Ithinh that this language was that of the Tolistoboir', Trocmi, and
Tectosagum aa, os those Golatoe who gave their name to Galatia.

Niebuhr, however, denies that it was Galatian that saJcrome
heard ; and, after noticing tho campaign of the Romans against
them, he adds in a note that “ St. J erome says that he heard
the samo language in Phrygia as at 'l'reves5 but this cannot be
referred to the Galatians, and St. J erome probably saw Germana who
had settled in Phrygia at different times, especially Goths, in the
