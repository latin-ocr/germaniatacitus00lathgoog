They 0011 be brought from no point nearer thau the water·
system 01 the Dnieper. Yet the water-system of the Duieper
will not give us the phenomenon required. The language 01
thet river is emineutly homogeneous (Russian); whilst the lan-
30030001 Saxony, 8110010,Βο11011110, Polaud, Pomerania, aud
Brandeuburg, although all Slavouic, ara spoken in nume·
rous dialects and sub-dialecto. To deriva all this from the
Duieper is to deduce the whole from the part, the old from
the new.

We have now taken a measure of 001110 01 the improbabili·
ties involved in the doctrine of a Slavonic 111131011011 10 the
Transalbian portion 011110 Garamum, between the times 01
Tacitus aud Oharlemague3 01111 though they 010 undeniably
great, their magnitude 10 only relative; 01111 0 certain degree 01
evidence may overbalance them. Difficult as it is to believe
that Poland was ever Germanic, there is, nevertheless‚ au
amount of testimony which would make it credihle. Had au
observer like (laesar visited the country iu perseo, 01111 known
it as well 00 110 knew Gaul, his dictum would, probably, have
outweighed all other difficulties. On the other hand, had a
writer of 110 character whatever classed it amongst the coun-
1110001 Germany, I should have troubled the reader with but
few reasons for objectiug to him, aud have disposed of his
evidence in a summary manner, by treating his statement as
an error.

The authority 01 Tacitus is intermediate to these two

Implicit and uneritical belief is not always the highest tri·
bute 01 respect. So 101 110111 finding any morbid feeling 01
pleasure iu taking exceptione to the statemeuts 01 0 31001
writer like Tacitus, I have no hesitation iu saying, that the
more 1 have criticised the more 111010 found to admira. So
numerous are the cases where 011 unscrutiniziug adoption 01
his statemeuts ouly mystifies us! Whereas the admission 01
the slightest amount of fallihility gives us 011 important fact.
Such, amougst others, is the statement 001100111111311101011-
guage of the AEstyii, and of the Gothiui (vid. 11011. in oo.)

More than this, the very latitude given to the term 0011110010,
though wrong as far as the facts which it implies are cou-
