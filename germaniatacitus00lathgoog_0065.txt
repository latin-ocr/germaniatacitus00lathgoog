It by no means follows that, because the Germanis of
Tacitus constitutes a very large tract of country, the whole of
the area occupied by the Germanic stock was therefore known
to that author.

He writes that it was separated from Dacia and Sarmatia
meatibus aot mutuo maa.

This is not the langnage ot' a precise geographer—indeed,
precise geography for the parts in question was in Tacitus's
time an impossibility.

Hence, any writer who may hold that there was a Germany
or Germane, either to the north or to the east of the limita
ascribed in the aeman, holds nothing nnreasonable. The
Dacians and Sarmatians might only have interrupisti the out-
lineos that area; in which case Germane might reappear on
the Lower Danube, or in Westem Russia, Germana of whom
Tacitus knew nothing, and ot' whom he had lost sight on
reaching the Dacian and Sarmatian frontier.

There is nothing unreasonable in all this; and the lilrelihoed
of the Germanic area ot' Tacitus being amabar, is just as open
a question as the likelihood of its being torpor, than the real
one. Individually, I believe it to be too wide ς’ but that is
no reason why others should not consider it too narrow.

This has been done. The greatest authority of Germany
bas expended much learning and ingenuity (langnage more
favourable than this cannot be applied to even the arguments
ot' the great author of the Deutsche Grammatik) on what
may be called the Gotic hypothesis.

Let it be admitted that the chauces against the name of a
locality reached by a body of emigrante, invaders, or oon-
querors, being identical with that of the locality from which
those emigrante, invaders, or conquerors started, are almost
infinite.

Thus, the chances are almost infinite against the nativo
New Zealand name of the locality of the present settlement

ἢ Though only in its eastern directior. lts northern arca was too small.
