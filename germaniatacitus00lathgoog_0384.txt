They were occupante of the parts eust of the Upper Vie-
tuln, or between the Vistula md Bug. They were well-
known tu the Greek writers of the Byzantina empire: and
the only question concerning them is, whether they were
Scythiam or Hune. -Οὗτοι δὲ ἅπαντες κοινῇ μὲν Σκύθαι καὶ

still the elmilarity ol* the name is remarkable

Consideringv however, that their neighhonrs ou the south
were the Gallu of the Danube, that the name is by no menne
necessarily native, that their country wne the water-ebed of
the Vistula und Bug, and lhatsufrquni=hill⁸ in Gothic, it ἰιι
by uo means unlikely that, different ns were the anticus, these
names may lmve been the same, 0¹⁴⁶, the German somn for
Hithandtr. still it is quite as likely to be nccldenlnh and,
if the Burufflmdt' of the Bug were Bulyan‘am, ie no.

But the difficulty does not end here* Ptolemy hus, han-‘dn
his Φρονγυννδίωνετ, a populati-m called Βσιινγούνται.

ιι, The Αἶλιινιιίωνες (ΗεΙνεεοηεε, see note in voe.) luy

b. The Lyyu't' omani eume ὑπὸ τοὺς Βονγυύντιις.

e:⁴ The Βονγιιύνι-αι mme eut of the Semnones, from the
river Suebus (Συύηὸοε) to the Vistula.

These are very diffieulz eonditiuns. At first it appears that
wa num separate the Βουιγαύνται from the Φροινγουνδίωνεε,
because Ptolemy mentione both: nurl that we must consider
the former tu be the Burffuudiam ο( aneonin, because
Ptolemy does ιιοι mention these latter.
