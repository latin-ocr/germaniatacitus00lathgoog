Ptolemy. They seem to have been 'south-eastem Hessians
northern Franeonianx or western Thuringians3 or, perhepS,
populations distributed between any two or all three ol' those
divisione—Chatti, Burgundions, or Thuringiens‚ politioally;
High Gemens, or Goths‚ ethnologically.

3. The Curiones, too, seem to have beenon the frontier of
Franconie and Thuringio3 their ethnologioal and politiool
conditione being those of the ‚Nertereanes and Dandum,
except thot they were less Hessian. Possibly they may heve
been Slavonians‚ ie, of the Upper Moine end Regnitz.

4, 5. From Ptolemy's notice, the Intueryi and Varyiones
were north-eost of Wisbeden (Vtxpi); perhaps on the Upper
Lehn. If so they may have been on the confines of the
Plntt-Dentsch end High German divisions-perheps divided
between the two.

that they were Germane of the great Arminian consedereoy.

If so, the name is Low Germen; and the Heseian form
would be Bessi.

This is verified (ond the suggestion is Grimm's) by the
following popular distich :-
