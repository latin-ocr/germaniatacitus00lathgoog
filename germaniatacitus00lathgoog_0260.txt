σιτοπομπίαν ἐπὶ rd Ῥωμαϊκά φροὺρια διαπέμπεσθαι.-Ὑπεδεξάμην μὲν ’
μοῖραν τοῦ Σαλίων ἔθνους, Χαμᾶἔους δὲ dthhwa—Eunap. in Exoheg.
Ausonius makes the middle syllable long:

Accedent vires, quas Francia, quasque Chamaves
Germanique tremunt-Mosella, 434.

The branch of tbe Germanic population to which the original
Chamavi belonged, was almost certainly the Old Saxon.

Amongst the obscurest of the traditionary heroes of the Westpha-
lian and Hanoverian *Germana is Ham, whose Latinized name is
Ammizas. This Ammius may, or may not, have been the eporrymua
os the Clam-avi.

A sbade is thrown over the common origines the different Cham-
avi by tho possibility of chana being a geographical term; in which
case it might apply to different populations, irrespective of ethnolo·
gical identity.

Ptolemy has, in the parts between the Danube and Thuringia not
only a population called Παρμω-κιίμποι, but one called Ἀδραξαι-
κόμποι also-a sure sign of the words being compound.

Now Zeuss tells us that he finds—and from the context his re-
mark either applies, or should apply, to this locality-in old docu-
ments not only a place called Clam, bnt Mardus Cdcmhe.*-p. 121.

Add to this the root Ham· in Ham-burg. For the Chamavi as
colonists, see Epileyoaaecc, ξ Chattuarii.

³daprdcarioa.]—This is a compcnnd name, the latter elementa
being the wore in Oantware=occupaata inhabitants.

The present town of dapem, near Herford, in Westphalia, the
supposed scene of Varus's defeat, probably preserves the name, and
fixes the locality of tbe Aaprtcara'a'. But the area wasa wide one.

That this identity is not taken np on light grounds is shown hy
the following extracta.

Generalis habet populos divisio ternos,
Insignita quibus Saxonis floruit olim 3
Nomina nnnc remanent, virtus antiqua recessit.
Denique Weatfcloa vocitant in parte manentes

Inbabitant osterliudi, qnos nomine quidam
