c. Tbat too little strecs is laid upon the undoubted Gallie
character of the county of Kent.

d. Τοο little, too, on the diminution of the Gallie area, by
leaving it nothing but the parts between the Scine and
Loire.

c. Above all, too little, to a passage 11 Strabo, stating that
the differences (admitted differcnces) between the Belga and
