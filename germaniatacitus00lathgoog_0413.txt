The Gepidae are mentioned in the Traveller's Songas Gifbns.

Their date and area are those of the Heruli and Longobards.

The tradition and the gloss Gepanto may be seen in
J ornandes, Idpilepomeaa, β ν.

ln Capitolinus we find notice of the Si-ootota in the reign
of Marcus Antoninus, as members of the Marcomannis oon-
federaoy in the Marcomannis war. This hasbeen supposed

to= Gepida -l-the prefix Si· (or sig-l, just as was supposed
to be the case with ›Si-cambri.

Vopiscus, in his Life of Probus first mentions Optas-
“ Oum et ex aliis gentihus plerosque pariter transtulisset,
id estex Gepidis, Grautungis ct Vandalis, illi omnes fidem
fregerunt.''—Prob. c. 18.

Mamertinus mentions their wara with the Tenc-inps. More
important, however, were their political relations with the
Longobards, the Avors, arrd the Thaifnl.

Their seat uvas the Middle Danube, in Dacia: their chief
King, Fastido,a name by no means uneqnivocally German
or Gothic.

Arda-rich, another chief, has a more nnequivocal name.

Jornandes separates thern from the Winidae-“ ln qua
Scythia prima ab occidente gens sedit Gepidcram, qnae
magnis opinatisque ambitur fluminibus. Nam Tisiauus per
aquilonem ejus corumque discurrit. Ab africo vero magnus
ipse Danubius, ab euro fluvius Tausis secat, qui rapidus
ac verticosus in Histri fluenta furens devolvitur. Introrsus
illi Dacia estad coronae speciem arduis Alpibus emunita,
juxta quorum sinistrum latus . . . Winidnrcm natio populosa
consedit.''—G. 5.

The parts about Singidunum and Sirmium are their most
definite localities.

They afterwards became subject- to the Hune.

An unknown writer of the ninth century says, “ Do Ge-
pidis autem quisdam adduc ibi resident.''
