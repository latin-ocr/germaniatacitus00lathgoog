kind must we take; the extermination os the people‚ or the
change of name?

The evidence in favour ot' the former view, is strong;
Tiberius-“ Sicambros dedentes se traduxit in Galliam atque
in proximis Rheno agris collocavit.''-Suet. Aug. 21.

Again,— “Germanico (bello) quadraginta millia dedititi-
orum trajecit in Galliam, juxtaque ripam Rheni sedibus as-
signatis collocavit.''-ldem, Tib. 9.

Tiberius, speaking of himself, says, that, “ Se novies a dive
Augusto in Germaniam missum, plura consilio quam wi per-
fecisse; sic Sicambros in deditionem acceptos, sic Suevos.'’-
Tac. Ann. ii. 26.

A stronger expression still occurs iu another place :-“ Ut
qnondam Sicambri excisi, et in Gallias trajecti forent, ita
Silurum nomen penitus extinguendum.”-Ann. xii. 39.

On the other hand,-

c. The name Sicambsi was probably Gallie, since we find
it in Caesar. Possibly, it was occlusiccly so; in which case,
the explanation is clear. lt disappeared as soon as the Ger·
mans, to which it applied, became known by their German
designatione.

b. lt was, perhaps, the collective name ot* a consederacy,
¹consisting cf Gaymi, Gambricii Marsi, and others; in
which case it became obsoleta when the consederacy was
broken up.

Ι do not profess to see my way clearly here; or to be
able to decide to even my own satisfaction. Nsither can I ex·
plain the relation between the names Si-ccmbri (Su-ycmbm)
and Gambr-ivii3 lor Ι think it would be unsafe to consider
it accidental.

Besides this, there is adlambere, conspicuous as a female
leader, in the Langobard traditione.

And, besides this, the Cimbri.

And, besides this, the root bmp :flpbts so that koapsor
:Jiybtioy·mco (clampica).

The syllable si·‚ both Zeuss aud Grimrn consider to re·
present the root si9=cictoric; and as pambor=strcaaac
Si-pcmbri = Sip-pambo· = strom for victory = slep-tc·
