tion (real or supposed) between the root Tout- in Tcutou·, and
the root daut- in Dect-sch. It runs thus. The syllable in
question is common to the word Tcut-oucs, Teutonicus, Theod-
c'ccus, teudiscua, tout-iscus, teu-ele, duit-isles, liat-cclcc, deul-sch
whilst the word Dect-scd means German. As the Teut-oucs
were Germane, so were the Cimbri also. Now this line of
argument is set aside hythe circumstance that the syllable
Teut· in Paul-oues and Teutonicus, as the names of the con-
federates of the cimbri, is wholly unconnected with the Teut-
in theod-iscus, and Dect-scd. This is fully shown by Grimm
in his dissertation on the words Germou and Dutch. In its
oldest form the latter word meant populor, sational, ecrou-
cucan- it was an adjective applied to the oulyunoupuc, or the
vernacular German, iu oppositiou to the Latin. In the tenth
century the secondary form Tcut-ouicus came in vogue even
with German writers. Whether this arose out of imitation of
the Latin form Romauicc, or out of the idea of an historical
connection with the Teutones of the classice, is immaterial.
Itis clear that the present word Daue-scd proves nothing
respecting the Teutoucs. Perhaps, however, as esrly as the
time of Martial the word Teutonicus was used in a general
sense, denoting the Germane in general. Gertain it is that,
before his time, it meant the particular people conquered by
Marius, irrespective of origin or locality.-See Grimm's

The Cimbri—Evidence to the Gothic origin of the Cimbri
(treated separately) begins with the writers under Augustus
and Tiberius.

Vell. humulus-The testimony os this writer as to the
affinities of the natione in question is involved in his testimony
as to their locality‚ and consequently subject to the same cri-
ticism. His mention of them (as Germane) is incidental.

Strabo-Ovs and above the references already made,
Strabo has certain specilic statements concerning the Cimbri:
α.) That according to a tradition (which he does not believe)
they left their country ou account of an inundation of the sea.
This is applicahlc to Germany rather than to Gaul. This
