NUl'ES ΟΝ SECTION 1. 5

The nmo *pplieu ω cornuin nuwmenu oonoemiug thu part taken
by the Beatam in the Mmedoninn wan-See not. in v. Bastar-me.

In the Fati Cepiwlini sor nu. 222, occurs the following
entry z—n. mnnxvs ιι. r. ι. xx. mmmm ni. nxxxi. οοι, n} οη,-

More than thiu—the record itself is not :bove suspicion. The
part of the utone which oontnins the letters n, lus been reputed,

dom, or whether it πυ ιο on the original stoue, I un neither essert
nor deny. I have osten seen the etone,but ilthough ι friend of
mine wished nm particula-ly ω mamm the truth, 1 wu never able
to oonvinoe myself whether the corner oontnining the nyllnhle ie pert
of the originss etone or not. It is evidont ‘hut the nme annot
hue been Cenomanis, uince they were *nied with the Rom-nn, and
theyisquite distinct. ammai doce not occur nmong the Romus.
