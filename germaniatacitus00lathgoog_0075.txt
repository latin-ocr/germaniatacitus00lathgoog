It is probable that Ι may appear too careless about the
aizo Ι give to certain ethnological areas, ay„ the F risian, the
Slavonic‚ and others; so as to look like a writer who finds
his Frisians, his Slavonians‚ or his any other equally—favoured
nation everywhere.

To anticipate this, Ι remark, that not only are large areas
-areas far larger than any given to any population in the
following peges-the commoneat of ethnological phenomena‚
but that they generally stand in the neighbourhood of small
ones3 so that the contrast between a multiplicity of ethno-
logical differences within a small area, and great ethnological
uniformity over a large one, is the normal condition of the
world. Thus—

c. In Asia—the vast ank, Mougol‚ libinose, and Persian
areas, are contrasted with the small ones of the Oancasian,
Himalayan, and Siberian populations.

l. In Africo-the Berber and Kaffre are similarly great;
the Felup‚ Sapi, Naln, ho, similarly small.

c. In Amorion-the Eskimo‚ Athabaskans‚ Algonkina and
Guarani take np hali of the continent. On the lower Missis·
sippi there are eight or ten mutually unintelligible tongues
within an area the sine of Yorkshire.'
