But, as the general character of an historical transaction may be
lrnown even where the details are forgotten, there are still points
upon which the great writers of the close of the republic may be
consulted.

N ow what did Ooesor consider their ethnological affinitias to bel
Gallio. Sallusti Gallie. Velleius Paterculusl Galllc. It is only
the later writers thot carry their origin north of Gaul.

But the Teutones are German at least. It is the same word as
Dect-sch. The preliminaries to this question are to be found
in not. inv. Gerrunio.

It is an undoubted fact that writers as early as Virgss, Lucan,
Juvenal, and Martial‚ use the epithet Tmtoaicus: and when they
do so they mean after the fsshion of Praetores.

But it is no undoubted fact that they mean thereby Gemma.
'l'hey mean of or belesmiae to the welbbnowra tanny mnqacercd by
Marius, without defining the country of that enemy.

It is also an undoubted fect that writers of the tenth century use
the epithet Teutonicus as equivalent to German, aa, as another form
ef Theotiscus.

This, however‚is after (and not before) the word Theclae-us has
been used for Germanus.

In other words, the epithet Teutonicus, although really a deriva-
tive of Teutones, passes for another form of Picent-istm, or as a
derivative from Tbeot or Dion, and so becomes a name for the Ger·
mans, simply because Theotiwi had been a name for them before.

But fbeotisci was no name for the Germana until the tenth cen-
tury, about one thousand years after the first use of the word
Pectore.

'lo talre a measure of the magnitude of this paralogiam, let
us suppose an advocate for the Belgic origin of the Lowlsnd
