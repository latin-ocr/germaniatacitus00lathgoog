The evidence of Tacitus makes them a mall nation. *show there
is the shade οι an objection ιο this. Helmoldus (i. 26) mentibus the
Bardi ,· whilst in the neighbourhood of Liineburg‚ so far north and
east as even the Elbo, there is a district called Bcrdcvsgowe, anda
town called Barderv-wik.

Acoount for the clement Βανά- by supposing the lango-borda ιο
have given the name, and the nation becomes a large one; so large
as ιο reaoh from Eriperes to Lv'ineburp. Good writers-perhaps the
best—have done this. Yet the termination -bard alone, minsas the
prolix, scarcely seems to warrant the 'inference

Far more important is the question as to tha relation which the
Langobardi who conquered Italy, and gave their name ιο Lombsrdy,

bore ιο these northern Langobards-the neighbonrs of the Angri-
varii and Angli, but this is the subject of a separato notice*

² Reudipat]-See note in v. Nuithones. The same error which
Tacitus is supposed to have made with the N cadmea, he is supposed
ιο make with the Reudigni. He mistalres the first letter ol their
names. Reudigni, according ιο Zeuss, is sor veae-tyni, or vocem
But thess Teutings are not exactly the Teutones, but the ferumvii,-

That the combination -s’psi is tho patronymie or gentile form -s‘ssg,
so that Reudipai=lleudispi=the Rescdinpe, is highly probsble.

'lhat the patronymic form in -c'vsg, can take the place of the ter-
mination -aooere is shown by the forms licat-inp-as=men ⁰f Kent, as
compared with Osos-warmistauuaas of K esst

But the lihelihood os Tacitus, who has hitherto given all his
names in cn unexceptionable form, blundering, when he begins ιο
blundsr, in two names out of six, is, ιο say the least, doubtful.

³Aoiossea.]-These are considered to be the catera· their name
being derived from the verb bosan. By the exact term suono

they arc not mentioned elsewhere. Ptolemy, however, has as one of
the tribes of the Gimbrie Chersonesus the Κοιανδοί. This name is ’

identified with Aviones by two processes :-
1. Rotas& is the participle of the verb laeuas.
