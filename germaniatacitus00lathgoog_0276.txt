Ita qui olim “boni sequique Cherusci,” nunc “inertes
ac stulti '' vocantur: Chattis victoribus fortuna in sa-
pientiam cessit. Tracti ruins Cheruscorum et Fosi,q
contermina gens, adversarum rerum ex aequo socii,
crim in secundis minores fuissent.

llOffl ou umori xxm.

¹ ssew-The first great fact in the history of the Cherusci is,
that they were the confederatus of Arminius, and the conquerors of
Varus

'fhe next is that they withstood the aggressione of their own
countrymen as stcadily as they did those of Rome.

The Cherusci are mentioned by Caesar, and mentioned as the
hereditary enemies of the Sueri. The Cherusci, too, it was who
first chcclred the conquests and consolidations of Maroboduus.

We may look upon the Cherusci* as the beads cf a great confeder-
aticn, not only on the strength of their history, but cn the evidence
of ancient writers, αφ, Strab0, ol Χηροῦσκοι καὶ ol τούτων ὑπήκοοι
-Tacitus, ‘⁸ Cherusci, motique corum?

If sc, the impcrt of the name may fluctuate, and sometimes mean
a particular people, sometimes serre as a collective designation, in·
cluding several such smaller divisione. This assumption cases many
difficulties-perhaps, indeed, it is absolutely necessary. We hear sc
continually of great natione, like the Chatti, Cherusci, Sigambri and
others, being contermincus, that, ifwe take the texts wherein such
notices occur literally, we leave no room for several minor natione or
tribes.

Thus, in the present instance, there are special statements which
bring the Cherusci- '

c. As far south as the Chatti.

b. As far north as the Chauci.

c. As far west as the Sicambri.

What rcom does this leave for such populations as the Chamavi,
Angrivarii, Fosi, dccl Little, if any 3 especially if we bring in

θ The full import of the Cheruscan resistunce to Rome, the vulne of the
patriotism of Arminius, und the extent to which the Cheruscan glory is as
much English as German, are well developed in Professor Creasy’s “ The
fifteen Decisive Battlcs of the Wcrld,'’ foremost amongst which he places
the defeat of the legions of Varus.
