clv THE GERMANY OF neonus

The objection‚ notified in not. ad v. Sonaotir (p. 16), against
the power of the word Jayk, finds its place here. ln Majiar
Jasop=dowmoa Now if we carry the existence of Majiars
iu Europe as far beyond the dato of the Siculi (supposing

them to be what is here suggested) as the Siculi are earlier
than the undoubted lllajiars, the name ol the Jazygoa may
be not Slavonie but Majiar.

This would, certainly, throw a doubt over many important
deductione. But, as the Maje‘ars may have taken the name
from the Jozyyea and having first called them boumont, called
others so also, l do not lay much stress on the fact. Besides
which the word Jozyle would not cease to be Slavonio simply
because it was Majiar also.

If we look bach on the evidence of these tribes being
Germanic, we shall lind what we found with the Gepida-
the evidence of their locality aud the testimony of certain
authors against them, that of their alliances and the names
of their leaders in favour of them.

Tho Rugii have the best claim. They have a nome in
common with the Rugii of Tacitus3 but this, even if liable to
no exceptione, would only imply a migration-not, neces·
sarily‚ a Germanic one. On the other hand, they are identi-
fied with the Teroiliapi, whose claim to be considered Ger·
mans is the worst.

The Heruli have their relations to the Anionem bnt this
only implies that the Aviones moved southwards.

Upon the whole, I think that none were German—but am
unable to distributo them among the Turk, Slavonio and
(even) Ugrian stocks.

The populations which now follow, have their relations with
English rather than Roman history.
