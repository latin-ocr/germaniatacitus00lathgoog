ferre impetus, disponere diem, vallare noctem, for·
tunam inter dubie, virtutem inter certa numerare:
quodque rarissimum, nec nisi ratione disciplinae con-
cessum, plus reponere in duce, qudm iu exercitu.
Omne robur in pedite, quem super arma ferramentis

Equestrium sane virium id proprium, cito parare
victoriam, citii cedere. Velocitas juxta formidinem,
cunctatio propior constantiae est.

who first worked it out, cia, the German philologists, Zeuss, Grimm,
and others. whether, however, the real nature os the change has
been explained, or rather whether any change at all has taken place,
isuncertain. Assar as 1 can ascertain the views os the writers in
question, their opinion seems to be that those Hessians of Hesse who
coincided with the ancient (lhatti, called ttnmelces hy that name
(Chatti). Is so, the old form has changed into the new one, and
the word which was now Hac was once etant, the change haring
taken place on Hessian ground, and under the influence os time
alone.

'l'his is not the view which the present writer adopts. He sees
no grounds for heliering that the Hessians ever used, as their own
