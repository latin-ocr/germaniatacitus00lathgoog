Ιιι run. 26, a Sicambri colora was employed aa far from
its own country as Thrace.

This is believed to have permanently settled in Huugary‚ on
the very spot whereon the city of Buda was afterwards built.
Iu a work quoted by Grimm‚ as [ascriptiones Sacroeanctae
Vetustatis, a stone said to have been dug up, “ in Bada veteri,
Mathiae regis Ungariae tempore, dum fundamenta jacerentur
aedium Beatrieis regiuae,'' bears the following inscription,—
“Legio sicambrorum hic prasidio collocata civitatem aedifica·
verunt quam ex suo nomine Sicambriam vocaverunt.”

The authenticity, however, of this stone is doubtful ; and,
even if were not ao, the ethnological fact it conveyed would
be, in and of itself, minute and unimportant. It has been
notioed, however, for a special reason. The fact of Sicam-
briaus ou the Danube, as wellas Sicambriana on the Rhine,
hasbeen admitted as undoubted. Instead, however, of the
colony being allowed to account for it, a Danubian origin for
the Rhenish Sicambrians, with migratione to match, has been
inferred.

Bytho end of the first century, the name Sicambri has
become of comparatively rare occurrence, and the very fact
of its not appearing in the Germania, ia a proci of the ex-
tent to which ita greatnesa has diminished.

The Frank successore of Glovis, as well as Oloris himself,
are often called Sicambri. In Gregory of 'lours' account .
of the baptismos Olovis, the bishop says,—“ Mitis depone
oolla, Sicamber, adora qnod incendisti, incende quod ad-
orasti.'‘

In all these casea, however, the term is a titular <treiciam ,·

Like Cherusci, then, Sicambri is a term which occurs

during the early period of the history of the population to
which it applied only.
