The statement ol ldatius in Ghronicon Roncallense is,
that the Vandals of Spain (dadai-usian Spain more particu-
larly) werc Wcodolt Silingi. These are admitted by Zeuss
to have been the Σίλιγγαι of Ptolemy; es well aa to have
been the occupante of parts so near Sileoic as Upper Lusatia
(p. 445).

Again‚ the papas Sil-ensis is admitted to bo a Latin form
of the Slavonic Zlcs-ane and Siccae-ane, the older forms
of tho present German Schlecien, and English Sil-ssia

Yet the similarity between all these forms, and the

Admitting it mysell, I consider the Vandals of hadal-ecia,
the Vandals of Genseric, and the Vandals of Gelimer to
have been no Germane, but Slavouiau Sorba, chiefly from
Saxony, but in some cases from parts so far east as Si-

lrontier may have come in contact with those of the south-
eastern.

This shows that the separation between the two branches
of the Wandals must not be carried too far3 indeed, we

upon the movements of the Vandals, whose allianee was with
the Goths, and the Vandals, whose alliance was with the
Alemanni, as blows against the majesty of Rome struck.right
