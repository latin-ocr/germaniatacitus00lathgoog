exactly coincide with the area of the British lauguage, it is
not au isolated instance.

Iu the time of Tacitus the parts between Moravia, Gol-
licis, and Hungary were occupied by nations speaking three
different lauguages-the German, the Pannonico lingua of
Tacitus, and the Gallica linquo of Tacitus.

At the pressat time three tongues mcet in the same parts
-the German, the Slovak, and the Polish of Gallicis, the
Majiar of Huugary being a fourth3 but that is of late intro-
duction.

Now if we assume much migration for these parts, the
migration must have beeu of the peculiar kind just indicated,
a chemical migration, so to say, a migration plus substi-
tntiou and replacement; a migration which, whatever it did
in the way of an indiscriminate abolitiou of all nationality, at
least left the bounderies of three different lauguages‚ and
their geographical relations to each other, much as it found
them.

Certain writers, however (as already stated), adopt the view

.of a German migration from the parts between the Elbe and
Vistula sufficiently exhaustive of the original population to
leave the country in a state of emptiness for the Slavonians of
the parts farther eastwards to fill up. These, as they borrow
their uotion of a cucusam from the science of physics, may
take their theory of replacement aud substitution from the
chemist. Volaotquoatwm.

Such the displacement. Whence came those who effected
itt Not from the country east of the Guttones. There wore
uo such Slavouians tlara Eust of the Guttoues (the supposed
frontier people of Germauy), the populations were wholly
either Lithuanic or Finnic until the last fcw centuries, and
are nearly so now. This, then, iano birthplace for the
Slavonians of Mecklenburg and Pomerauia.

Did they come from the south-«cla, from Bohemial No!
Bohemia‚ according to the hypothesis, was German, besides
which, their lauguage was, probably, less like the Bohemian

. than the Polish.
Theu they came from Polandt Not evcn this. Poland

was occupied by Lygiau Germano. d
