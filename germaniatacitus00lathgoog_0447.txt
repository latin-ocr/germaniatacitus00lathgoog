b. The probably Slavonic Varini worshipped in the Isle of
Rngen.

c. The hely island of Tacitus is that ol the Angli—

d. With whom the Varini are inaccurately associated-

c. The source of the inaccuracy lying in the factos that
nation having a hely island, different from that of the Angles,
but not known to be so.

Now the passages that prove the Varini to have frequented

¹ the Isle of Rugen, prove something more. They prove their
paganism. They prove, also, that some part of them were
occupante of an island 2-“Est autem insula quadam, non
longe a civitate illa, habens mare interjectum, quasi itinere
unius diei, Verania nomine.”—“ Intellexit ergo vir Dei, Vera-
nos evangelican gratiae indignos.''-“ Erant autem trans
mare barbari crudelitate et saevitin singulares, qui Verani
dicebamus—Vir. Otton. Episcopi Boll. Jul, pp. 412, 413,
444.

Further still-and this bears on the ethnology of the
Rugii-although it has been shown (Prokpomena, p. xix.)
that the ·9·‚ in the name of the lsle of Rogare, appears as early
astho nse of the word Ropioni in Helmoldus, the equivalent
forms Rani and Itoni (without the g) must be remarked.
Now this omission of the -p- is exemplified by a vast variety
of other forms, ay, Eunai, Iluam, Bojoni, Boio, Rojo, Iloju,
Roiann,and others, to be fonnd in Zeuss (p. 665).

What is the effect of thiel It subtracta from the likelihood
of the Ray-ii of Tacitus being the Regiani of the Isle of
Royan, and, pro tanto, favonrs the inference drawn from their
juxtaposition to the Lemouii, or the notion that they are the
populations of the Gulf of Ripa-See nott. in vv. Rugii and
Lemovii.

The Varini, then, are not to be considered Ληθὼ.

2. The Apionos, whether obit or Oluoioncc (seeEpileyomena‚
ᾖ oti-i), are a population of which we know nothing that
helpe the present question. If identical with the nation bear·
ing a similar name, further south, thoy must have effected a
migration. Upon 'the principle of not making this longer
than is needfnl, we must place them scoth of the Angli, rather
than nortl. Now this southern locality, thus assumed, is a
