the ninth century, was undoubtedly divided between these
Litbuaniaus and slavoniam, absolutely German even in the
eyes of Tacitus. At the mouth of the Vistula the Alapta·

spoke a language like the British.

Let these AEstyians, on the strength of their aarum Bri· ·

tanaim propior, be called the uonGermanic portion of the
so·ealled original Germanic area; and—

Let the Praesidae, on the strength of their Lithuanic
tongris, be called the acu-Slavonic portion of the same area as
it appears in tbe 12th century.

It will be found that the relation of the uoreSlavouic
portion of the Slavonian period, was exactly that of the uou-
Germanic portion during the Germanic period-ie, both the
AEstyians and Prussians occupied the same locality.

Hence, the displacement of these Britanno-Germania popu-
lations (and the statement of Tacitus is as valid for the
AEetyiuus speaking a lauguage like the Britisb as for any
single fact connected with these parts) must have been accom-
panied with a remarkable act of discrimination—since the
parts occupied by the populations like the Britielr became
Litbuuaio and not Slavonic, the remainder Slooouio and
not Lithuauic. This nice appropriation of different parts of
the different areas cannot be said to add to the probability
of the migration which must be assumed. Such a migration‚
annihilating the population, traditione, and local names, and
all the substantial realities of a vast district, and, yet, pre·
sarving the form of its ethnological area, is, to say the least,
a very remarkable one3 since it gives us a phenomenon
which is better ascertained in chemistry than in history, aa,

A further consideration of the probabilities hereiu involved

But it may be urged that the langnage of Tacitus respect·

closely? Grauted. But what statement is more explicit.
If we doubt or qualify this, why not doubt or qualify much
more; ay, the Germanic position of the Lygii. Thisis what
should be done. All that is required is consisteucy.
