clement is not so clear. Considering the nature of the Frisian
habitato, l believe it ιο represent the word reen=fen This, however, ⁹
isbut ο guess.

The Frision characteristic elluded ιο above ie—

l. The great prepondemnce of oompound words, ending in the
equivalent ιο the English -tcm, end German -lteim,-e.9., Threehing-
Ιιοοι, oppon-heim.

2. The peculias form this elementjtelres.

This is -um, the t being omitted, end the vowel being nt

In Frieslcnd itself so abundantem these oompounds ol em, thet
two out os three (sixteen out of twenty-leur) ol the ploces noted in
the mep within n few miles of Leeuwerden, end in thet element. ⁴*

second-Here but few words ere eompounded ol the equivalent
to tom end -ltet'm nt all 5 perhaps none except the word Rittium ,-
which is int end e.

Thus we hove the two extremes ς ie, the Frisien topogrepby et
its οιαοίοιοιοι in Friesland, end οι its oeinimum in Zeelend.

Between these two extremes the following is the order of transition.

&recingere-Here the Frisien compound predominetes, end thet
with the Frisien form. In the arrondtssenwut ol Appingednm only,
we heve eighteen names in -οοο

In Groningen, however, we find occasion ιο mention another
Frisisn characteristic—the omission ol -οο and en et the end of
words. Hence, all true Frisisn oompounds of mn end in ·ma,· es
Hettemc end Helbertsena, whilet the numerous words that, ino
fencountry, ere eompounded of daos, take such forms ee the follow·
ing words in the arrmtdissement of wmmhoten-Holwierdc (not
dom), Utwierda, bc.

Now in Winsohoten‚ although the Frisien characteristic of the
final -a be carried to n great extent, the forms in- ·om are few. In

the next province-

Drcntlte-they do not occurat ell. But Drenthe, lihe Winsohoten‚
seems to be reclnimed land, end es such, the totino of s population
less aboriginel than that of Frieslond end Groningen.

osennae-a, Ammodiosment of Molle-Here we heve three
oompounds os lem, niu Blonhenham, Windes-heim, and Wilsnm
-oll three different, one Soron, one German, ond one Frieien.

’ The mep referred to is Van Longenheuzen'e, nn. 18433 the scole being
esmell querto pege to ecch Province. No topographicnl knowledge beyond
whot is thus supplied is pretendcd to.
