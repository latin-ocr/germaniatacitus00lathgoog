guages, as in many other of the Indo-European tongues (the
Keltic and Latin included), the roots mor and mori mean seu
end deod respectively:—“Septemtrionelis Oceanus, Amal-
·chium eum Hecataeus appellat, a Parapamiso amne, qua
Scythiam alluit, quod nornen ejus gentis lingua significat con-
gelatum, Philemon Morimarasam* a Cimbris (qu. Cimmeriis)
vocari scribit: hoc est mare maneamusque ad promontorium
Rubeas, ultra deinde droaitnn '' (13).

One point, however, still remains: it may be dealt with

briefly, hut it should not be wholly overlooked, ola, the ques-

Ι tion, whether, over and above the theories as to the location of
the Cimbri in the (limbric Chersonese there is reason to be-
lieve, on independent grounds, that Keltic tribes were the early
inhabitants of the peninsula in question? If such were
actually the case, all thathee preceded would, up to a certain
point, be invalidated. Nowl know no sufficient reasons for
believing such to be the case, although there are current in
ethnography many insufficient ones.

1. In the wey of philology‚ it is undoubtedly true that words
commento the Keltic tribes occur in the Danish of Jutland,
and in the Frisian and Low German of Sleswick and Hol-
stein3 but there is no reason to consider that they belong to
an aborigiual Keltic tribe. The o priori probability of Kelts
in the peninsula involves hypotheses in ethnography which
are, to say the least, far from being generally recognised.
The evidence as to the lauguage ol aborigines derived from
the significance of the names of old geographica] localities, is
wanting for the (limbric Chersonese. The arguments as to
the origin from Jutlaud of certain Keltic tribes iu England
(ay, the Picts) either rest upon the historicel evidence
that has just been discussed, or else involve a vicious circle of
argument.

2. No traditione, either Scandiuavian or German, point
towards an aboriginal Keltic population sor the localities in
question.

3. There are no satisfactory procis of such in either
archacology or natural history. A paper noticed by Dr.
Pritchard of Professor Eschricht's upon certain tumuli in
