It cannot be denied that the contrast between the evidence
ol Tacitus, who wrote from what he heard in the second,
and the evidence of the authors of the time of Oharlemagne,
who wrote from what they haara iu the ninth, is remark·
able. What are we to say?

1. That the evidence of Tacitus must be impugned.

2. That the evidence of Tacitus must be limited.

3, Or, that a vast system cf migratione aud displaeements
must be assumed, iu order to reconcile the first accurately
known state of things with the testimony of a writer whom
we are unwilling to take exceptione tol

Whiehever of these views be adopted, our decisiou ought
to be made after a very careful and mature deliberation.
There are complicatione ou both sides, and the whole ques·
tion is a balance of conflicting difficulties.

The occupation of the tract of country between the Vistula
and the Elbe in the tenth century by Slavouians ie priord
socie evidence of a similar occupaucy in the second.

The term Germania, applied to the same by Tacitus, is
primdsaeie evidence the other way. To decide in favour of
a Slavouic population on the strength of the former fact,
irrespective of the condictiug testimony of Tacitus, is illegi-
timate; but it is equally so to take that testimony without
doubt, qualificatiou, or scrutiny. To place evidence opposed
tethea priori probabilities upon the same level with evi·
deuce supported by them is unseientific iu the extreme3
indeed the writer who does it places all evidence on the
same level, and requires the same amount of testimony for
probabilities and improbabilities‚ for the barely possible aud
lor the morally certain.

Of all the populations east of the Elbe which Tacitus, in

the second century, called German, no single vestigo appears
in the tenth. How is thiat Was the original statement
