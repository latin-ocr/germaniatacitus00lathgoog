supposing them to have been thus exceptional to their country·
men, they may be considered as the only Germana of whose
existence in tbe time of Tacitus we are sure.

It was as little for the want of actual wars and migratione

' as for the paucity of hostile neighbours, that these exceptional
Germans of the Danube are found, in the fourth, filth, sixth,
seventb, and eighth centurias, in the locality assigned to them
by Tacitus iu the second.

There was much of each. This we know ιο bave been
the caso. Of similar wars and similar migrations, on the
Oder and Vistula, we know nothing; wo only assume them
for the sake of accounting for a supposed change ol popula·
tion.

Now it is certainly unscientific to attribute so much, iu
tbe way of displacement, to the wars and migrations of which
we know nothing, when those which we do know are known
ιο have done but little. On the real theatra of action, the
Middle Danube, what is it that we find in the time of
Tacitus? Romans, Germane, Slamnians, all on the Rhaetian
and Pannonian frontier, tha Romans having the lion's share
of country. What in the time of Theudorici Germane,
Romans, and Slavonians, the Germana possessing much of
what the Romans bad lost. This is what wo see on the
points illuminated by the clear light of history; and the
changes implied are but moderato. In the parts beyond,
however, everything increases its dimensions. The wars are
more exterminating, and the migrations longer, the displace-
ments greater than anything known elsewhere. Is this the
view which we get from that cautious induction which measures
the unknown by the known, or is it a mere sketch of the
imagination, where all things show larger in the twilight, and

Ι where anything may be assumed, because, though there is

nothing ιο support an hypothesis, there is nothing to con-

Necdum finitus Oresta—The list of improbabilities against
the doctrine of the double migration, are named legion. The
inroad which so obliterated the eastern Germana of the
Germania of Tacitus, was not exclusively Slavonic; it was
Lithnanic as well. Neither was the whole area which, in
