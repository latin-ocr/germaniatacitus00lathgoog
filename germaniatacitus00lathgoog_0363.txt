The three texts of Jornandes, Paulus Diaconus, and the
Traveller's Song, give'us the rough materials for the criticism
of the traditione of the Gothic nation. Their historical and
ethnological value is another question.

To begin with Jornandes. He quotes more thau one
earlier than himself, ay, Dio, Dexippus, and Ablavius. For
contemporary events, any statement of any such writer is
valuable.

But what is the value of such earlier writers, in respect
to the times anterior to their own! in respect to the archae·
ology, ethnology, or oriyincs of the Gothic nationsl

Many put this high; since tho Germania of Tacitus espe-
pccially mentions the existence of carmina antiqua, and
access to the carmi-ao antiqno is what may fairly be allowed
to Ablavius at least.

The following facts, however, subtract from their velue :—

a. Adaptations to the traditions of other natious (real or
supposed), lmown to J ornandas and Paulus Diaconns through
their ecclesiastical and classical learning are heterogencously
intermixed with the proper Gothic narratives.

b. ln the case of Jornandes, numerous real or supposed
facts, relating to the Gctae, are confused with those relating to
the Gothi.

These objections are of special application. To which
must be added those which apply to tradition in genera13
even in its most unexceptionable form. Upon these, however,
the present is no place for enlarging. Tha only question, at
present, under notice, is the extent to which the miyratioas,
which we find in the two Latin writers (for the Traveller's
Song has but little in this way), rest upon truc and genuine
tradition—true and genuine tradition being tho transmission
of the account of an actual event from one generation to
another, by nawritten communication.

For this. it is absolutely necessary that the event trans·
