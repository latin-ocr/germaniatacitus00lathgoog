between the Frisiane of Sleswick and the Frisians of Hanower
is interrupted3 a fact possible enough, but still a fact requir-
iug the assumption of morements and displacemente of which
history supplies no record.

This will be further considered in the next section.

The preliminaries and complemente to this ᾗ are the ἕξ on

Important as‘are the Aerulos, it is not too much to say that
they aro only known through their relations to ue of mpl-
land, their descendants; indeed, without this paramount fact,
they would be liable to be confused with the Frisians, with
the Old Saxone, with even the Slavonians.

This is chiefly because there is no satisfactory trace or
fragment of the Angles of Germany within Germany3 whilst
the notices of the other writers of antiquity tell us as little as
the one we find in Tacitus.

And thie notice is not only brief but complicated.

The Eudoses, Nuithones, Aviones, Suardones, and Reu-
digni received what little light falls upon them from the single
circumstance of their being mentioned along with the Angli.
They pios none.

The Varini, of whom the separate substantive and inde-
pendent information is greater, complicate the question, by
being a population for whom a Slavonic affinity may fairly be
supposed.

The complicatione engendered by the term Sauo have
already been noticed.

Surely, then, it ie not too much to say that if it were not
for the settlemeut in England, the Angli would have been as
great a mystery to us as the Cheli, the Eudoses, the Phun-
dueii, or even the Hellusii and Oxionas. We know them from
their reaches only ; and if it were not for these, involving‚ as
they do, the English and Aegle-Saron languagee and litera-
