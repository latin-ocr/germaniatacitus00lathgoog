mund, ta, in some form equivalent to hicet-men, Eustware (like
(lant-ware), Euat-hrad, or lieet-suetan (like Dor-set).

Feiling this we should expect, at least, a derivative form such as
hester-ling, Exest-inq.

The form, however, is simple; just as if we said the Busta.

Simple, however, unitis, the following extract from Alfred places
its meaning beyond reasonable doubt :— “ See Visle is swibe
micel ee, and hio ιο lit Vitland, and Veonodlsnd, and paet
Vit-lend, belimpelt ιο Eoum, and seo Visle lit ut of Veonodlande,
and lit in Ilotmere, and se Ilstmera is huru fiftene mila brad.
'l'honne cymet Ilfing eastan in Eetmere, of pum mere pe 'Prusa
standelt in state, and cunrad ut samcd in E'stmere Ilfing emtori
of Enstlendq and Visle suban of Veonodlande.”

Itis as sale, then, to consider the word AEetii ιο mean the men os

2. The particular word in question is known ιο have been applied
by the Germane ιο the particular parts in question.

3. There is no other language but the German in which it occurs
with the same power.

4. 'l'be German name for the present Esttoniaru is Eodem their
country being Est-lond.

This last fact suggests an objection.

It may be said ιο prove too much, ta, ιο prove that these sup·
pcsed AEstion the Ecaten populations are not sufficiently in tlte Euat,
te, that the trus Baetem countries of the Baltic are on the Gnls os
Finland.

Alfred’s evidence meets thie.

Again-the fact of the atumem being the precem Estben, or
mea ‹aftloe Εοοι, is by no means conclusive as to the nomam
having been the AEstii ol Tacitus. A term like the one in question
would apply ιο different countries according ιο the advanoe os
geographical knowledge; cessing to be characteristic as soon as
fresh tracts east of those which it originally designated by it became
known.

Δι any rate, the present Etitouio may have been the most eodem
part of the AEstiac country.
