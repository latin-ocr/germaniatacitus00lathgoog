to the J utos of Iul-laud, one being a name in one dialectos

IV. Is there any connection between the Getae of Moesia
aud tbe Gothini, the Gotbones, the Gothlanders, the Jut-
laudere, bre, all or any? In putting this question, we must
remember that the country of tbo θεία is the country of the
Gotho also.

The difficulty involved herein, bus already been indi-
cated*

So bas the explanation of the greatest Gothic scholar
living.

The present writer, in admitting the difficulty, differs
from Grimm, by admittiug the migratioasrom Gmnaay also.

But he believes that that migration was not undertaken
by Germane calling themselves Gotho.

Hc finds no evidence that they called themselves so before
they reached the country of the Geta.

They then took tbe name, ond aot hefom just as the
Koat-ings of Angla-Sason England took a name from the
Kellic connty of Kent.

This, however, is only a preliminary consideration. The
real question is whether, or not, the similarity of name be·
tween tbe' Get· of the Lower Danube and the th of
Gallicia and Prussia be accidentali or is it reforable to
etbuologioal connection?

ln this case, the distance is sufficient to admit of the
resemblance to be occidental ; end Ι do not prees the relation·
ship. Still Ι believe in it.

The same Slavouians who, as frontagers, called the onc
Guddoa, were tho frontagers to the Getoe also.

In this case tho connexion is corbet, aa, it is of the same
sort which gives the seme name to the Welsh of Britain,
and the Italicas, whom the Germane called Welsb also.
The Germanic populatione, which fill up tho interval, agree

iu calling their eoa-Germanic neighbours by some form of
the root W·l.
