dentally. lt may safely be said, that if this has happened at
all, it bas happened against great odds.

Yet the solution is obscure3 we cannot well suppose the
Gottt to have migrated 110111 the land 01 the Getas whilst
the notion that the Geta came from the Gothi, is set aside by
the greater antiquity 01 the former name (Geta).

Is there any other explanation 3

In what may be called the Getic hypothesis, itis held that
the Goths were Getae, and the Getes Goths, from aa de-
giaoioy; in other words, the second 01 the assumed facts is
denied, oia, the origin of the Goths in Germany‚ and the mi·
gration from that country. There was no migration at all. The
Goths were on the Lower Danube 1101111111 beginning, and they
were known to the earlier Greek and Latin writers as Getas.

Such the doctrine. Now, as there is the evidence 01 more
than one good writer 01 antiquity‚ as to the Thracians being in
the same category with the Getes, the Thracians must have
been Gothicas well. Hence the questions involved in the
hypothesis iu question are of considerable magnitude.

Such is the point of view from which the views developed

in Grimm's History 01 the German Language, must be
seen in the first instance. The details by which it is sup-
ported are elaborate, but eminently unsatisfactory. Reasons
101 thinking them uunecessary are given in the sequeb* where·
the difficulty arising 110111 the similarity 01 name is admitted,
'but differently explained.
