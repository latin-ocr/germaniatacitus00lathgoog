been removed from the lower Rhine to Burgundy, ae colo-
niete, and to have settled on the Doube.

From the end of the eighth century downwarde, the notices
of apayra, and comitator Attacrc'orrao are numerem-the
locality being the valleye of the Vincenne, Tillo, and Beze,
and the neighbouring parts of the water-eystem of the
Doube.

The papae commavorum joined thepagus attoariorum on
the Doube, even aethe areae of the clamavi and Attuarii
were conterminous on the Lower Rhine. For the numerous
references to these interesting settlements‚ ece Zeuee, pp. 582
-584, They deserve more attention from local antiquariae
than they have found.

ΙΙΙ. The Χαιτούωροι of Plomma-This writer, who says
nothing about any Chattuarii on the Lower Rhine, placeo a
population with a name so like it aa Χαιτ-ούωροι on the part
between· the Upper Rhine and Danube, amonget the Dan·
duti, Turones, Merovingi‚ and other widely different rectione
of the Germanic population3 and, to add to the confusion,
he places Κασ-ουάροι not very far from Χαιτ-ούωροι.

Is thie to be put down to erroneoue information‚ and to
pase as inaccuracyl Probably. At the same time an
intrusion of Chatti, from the southern portion of their area

may have taken place, and the name cmm, or Chasuarii
⁶ (Haazi or Haza-carii) have thus originated. The Low
German form in 4, however, ie against this view.
The fact of an inaccuraey ie the likelier.

Ι. The Saevi of ductim-The name of the country called
Suabia ie a true ethnological term, even aa Fraocooia ie one.
The one meane the country occupied by the Sacri, the other
the country occupied hythe Fraoka. Bovario is another
euch name, derived from the Boii. Saaooy ie in a similar,
though eomewhat different, predicament. They all, however,
agree in being names of countriee derived from their po
palatione. Herae ie, probably, the saure, and Tharaoye'c
