c THE GERMANY 01¹ merrus,

German, and but few have considered Slavonic‚ we have in
tha different Hun‚ Alau, Arar, and Bulgarian alliauces the
following-
' 1. Alpibzuri, al. ’Apu-torpor, duc.

2. Alci-dauri, al. Uicini-zoroe, Οὐλτόζονροι. bc. Ἴ

3. Augi-soiri.

4. Ακότ-ζιροι.

If we add to these the word ending iu yurii, the number
is increased—Sata-yurii‚ Ouoporii‚ &o

§xxxvn rua arsur.

It has been stated that the Alaus were of the Turk stockz
aud as the Sciri hare been placed iu the same category with
them, the Sciri being a people that has sometimes been con-
sidered German, the investigatiou of their ethnology finds
placo iu the present work.

The two broad facts that bear upon this question are-

l. The area of the Alans is beyond that of either tho
Germans or the Sarmatians. This was the parts due north
of Oircassia, or the great irregular triangle formed by the
Lower Dos, the Lower Volga, and Caucasus.

2. The present occupauts of this area are the Nogay
Tartars of the Turk stock—occupants who cannot be shown
to be of recent introductiou. ’

3. Luciau (Toxaris 51) makes them Scythians-Torira δὲ

ἔλεγεν ὁ Μακέντης, ὁμόσκευος καὶ ὁμόγλωττος τοῖς Ἀλανοῖς
ὤν· κοινὰ γὰρ ταῦτα Ἀλανοῖς καὶ Σκύθαις, πλὴν ότι οὐ πάνυ
κομῶσιν οἱ Ἀλανοὶ ὥσπερ οἱ Σκύθαι. Ἀλλὰ ὁ Μακέντης καὶ
ταῦτα εἴκαστο αὐτοῖς καὶ ἀποκεκάρκει τῆς κόμης, ὁπόσον
εἰκός ἦν ἔλαττον κομᾶν τὸν Ἀλανὸν τοῦ Σκύθου.

This reduces the stocks that may fairly claim them to three.

1. They may have been the most northern brauch of the
Circassiaus.

2. The most southern of the Ugrians.
3. Turks.

The Turk character of the present population favours the
third of these stocks.
