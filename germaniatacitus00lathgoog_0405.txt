lrind of Gorvey (i. p. 634) “Sami vero Transeundum· illam
quam incolunt regionem eo temporo invaserunt, quo Saxones
cum Longobardis Italiam adiere, et ideo aliis lepidas quam
Saxones utuntur.''

IV. Tho Noram, or Nordosqaaui.-ln King Theodobert's
Epistle to the Emperor J ustinian we find the name Norsaoi
of which the more correct form is probably Nor-suavi, or
Nordsaaoi—“ subactis Thuringis. . . Norscooram gentis uobis
placata majestas colla subdidit.’'-Ducherne‚ i. 862.

In the Annales Mettenses ad nn. 748 (Perta i. 330), “ Pip-
pinus adunato exercitu per Turingiam in Saxoniam veniens
fines Senonum, quos Nordosqaaoos amanteum valida manu

intravit. Ibique duces gentis asperae Sclavorum in occursum ⁰

ejus venerunt, unanimiter auxilium illi contra Saxones ferre

Now Zeuss identifies these Norsuaoi with the Saevi
' Troasdodcai; and, for some time, I followed his view. But
a little consideration will show that it by no means follows,
that because the Saaoi Transdadaaa' were Saevi ia tta North
they were, there, the Nordsaooi.

A Lincolnshire colony in the East Ridiug of Yorkshire,
would certainly be Englishmcn North os tte Hamae, yet
they would nothe N ortt-ambricae.

Ι am induced to draw the distinction from the following
facts:-

a. All the extracta in Zanes—the ones on which all my
knowledge of the subject rests-call those Saaoi of whose
colonial character there is the clearest evidence-not Nord·
socci, but simply Saooi.

i. The Nordsaaut are spoken of as a yaos.

This seems a sufficient reason for disconnecting-

a. The Saevi of the settlement founded in Alboin's timo
from the—

i. Nordsoooi of the yona, conquered by Theodobcrt.

The reasoning hitherto hasbeen that the word Saea, ori.
ginally Keltic‚ was applied to the Sonthern Germans exolu-
sively, so that it was Keltio in the way that Tetradis Slavonic:
