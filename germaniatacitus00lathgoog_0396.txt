Gallias appetunt, egressique ad terras mom unum de regno
Tlreodorici devastant atquo captivant, oneratisque navibus
tam de captivis quam de reliquis spoliis reverti ad patriam

cupiunt. Sed rex eorum in litus residebat, donec naves
altum mare comprenderent, ipse deinceps secuturus; quod
cum Theodorico nuntiatum fuisset, quod scilicet regio ejus
fuerit devastata, Theodebertum, filium suum, in illas partes
cum valido exercitu ac magno annomur apparatu direxit.
Qui, interfecto rege, hostes navali proelio superatos opprimit,
omnemque rapinam terrae restituit.”-iii. 3.

who killed Higcloc was that of the Hert-wara.

In a document of ln. 769, we find-“Silva quae vocatur
Helai, in aquilonari parte fluvii Rurae.''

Later still wo find the form Heca, and, at the present

a. Chattuarii, or Ait-uarii.

h. In High German Hazzoarii.†

Whose name also was either compouud or simple, ia,
Chattuarii or Chatti, Hazzoorii or Horam this latter form
being preserved in the present form, Essem which is High
German in respect to the ss, but Old saxon ln respect to the

· omission of the initial aspirate.
ln Tacitus (Anu. i. 50, 51) wo find a notice ol the Siloa

Caria, the locality ol tbo Marsi, aud the seat of the worship
ol the dea Tacfaoa.

This looks like tho nume of the country about Esica in its
oldest forms.

The connection between the Marsi, Gambrivii, and other
populations belonging to the Sicambriaa division, with the
Chattuarii, is somewhat doubtful.

The name may have originated in the root oas- of the
alna Uasio, and so have been older than that of the popula-
