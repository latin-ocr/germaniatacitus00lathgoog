01 Sallust and Gioero, the language points to Gaul as the
home of the nation in question; and that without the least
intimation 01110 being any particularly distant portion of that
country. “Per idem tempus adversus Gallos ab ducibus
nostris, Q. Oaepione et M. Manlio, male pugnatum-Marius
consul absens factus, et ei decreta provincia Gallia.''-Bell.
dugurth. 114. ‘⁶ Ipse ille Marius—influentes in Italiam Gal·
lorum maximas copiae repressit.”—Gicero de Prov. (100001. 13.
Αο(1 here an objection may be anticipated. It is undoubtedly
true that even if the Oimbri bad originated ina locality so
distant 00 the Chersone-se, it would have been almost impos·
sible to have made nucha 1001 accuratelyunderstood. Yet it
is also true, that if any material difference had existed between
the Cimbri and the Ganls 01 Gaul, such must have been fami-
liarly known in Rome, since slaves 01 both sorts must there
have been common.

Oaesar, whose evidence ought to be conclusive (inasmuch as
he knew of Germany as well 00 01 Gaul), fixes them to the
south 01 the Marne and Seine. This we leurn, not from the
direct text, but from inference: ‘⁴ Gallos-a Belgis Matrona et
Sequana dividit.''-Bell. Gall. i. 1. “ Belgas—solos 0000 qui,
patrum nostrorum memoria, omni Gallia vexata, Το010000 (lim-
brosque intra 11000 0000 ingredi p1·ohibueriut.''—Bell. Gall. ii. 4.
Now if the Teutones and Cimbri had moved from north to
south, they would have clashed with the Belgae first, and with
the other Gauls afterwards. The converse, however, was the
fact. 11 10 right here to state, that the last observation may
be explained away by supposing either that the Teutones and
Cimbri here meant may be a 0001000101 the confederation on
their return, or else a portion that settled down in Gaul upon
their way3 or finally, a division that made a circle towards
the place 01 111011 destination in 0 south-east direction. None
01 these, however, seem the plain and natural coustmction;
and I would rather, if reduced 10 the alternative, read
Germania instead 01 Gall‘, than acquiesce in the most
probable of them.

Diodorus Siculus, without defining their locality, deals
throughout with the Cimbri 00 0 Gaulish tribe. Besides this,
he gives 00 000 01 the elemento of the assumed indistinctuess
