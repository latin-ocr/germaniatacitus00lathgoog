In this case, Chattuarii isthe Low German form of a name
ol the Marsi and othere, taken from the forest district they
occupied-just as numerous minor tribes might bc called
Hercynio, or Baoeuio, from the Hercyniae or Buconica
foresta.

But it may also indicate a settlement of intrusive Chatti
from Harae, and the name be newer than the populatiou.

I inclinato the former of these views3 still admitting the
difficulty involved in the fact of populations with names so
like as Chattuarii ( = Occi-cola), Clas-uarii (occupante of the
Haec), and elam· (occupante of Hense) being sucalled, inde·
pendent of any special connection.

The hypothesis that the siloa Cario was a common rather
than apropcr name, and, aa such, one which might occur in
more districts than one, would solve the difficulty. The
solution, however, is, at best, hut hypothetical. If valid,
however, Herae iteelf might be but a ailoe Orac-io, just as
Baepuudy wasa Virpaat.

Hence, tlro Chattuarii were High Germane or Low Ger-
mane, according to the view we take of the origin of their
name. Or they may have been modificat High Germans— ⁸
High Germane in origin, but Low Germana in locality, and
several other characteristica

We have seen that, although the word Uluti-corii is not
the Low German form for the Olor-uarii of the Hace, it is
something of the kind. It is the Low German name of the
Haza-carii of Eneca, and the parts about that town.

If Low Germane, they ware, probably, Platt·Deutsch
rather than Saxon, and Frisian rather than Platt·Deutsch-
the reasoning running thus :- Ι

α. Their hostility to tha Saxone is evidence, as far as it
goes, for the two populations belonging to different divisione.

Chattuarian area, were Furiana-“Frisium qui vocantur
