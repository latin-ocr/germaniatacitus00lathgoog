indicandum, ne omnino putetis notitiam nostmn ingere. quod
occultum creditis rochabera Proinde requirite nos saepius per vias,
quas amor vester aperuit. Quia semper prodest divitum regum

The further confirmation which this view receives from the facts
connected with the modern name Guddou is exhibited in Eptago-
meuc, §Getta

⁶dataque Brltouuieoe maort-Here an author like Tacitus

commite himself toa definite statement, and it must not be set
aside on light grounds. Either the c priori probabilities against
it must bs great, or some reasonable origin of the mistakc must
be pointed out.

'the latter cau bs done—not exactly as the statement abent the
Gctbioi was explained, but in a scmewhat similar manner. 'Phe
language that the people of the ambenccast really spcke when they
first become definitely known, was the Perusiae. Now the form of
the name which that lauguage took was sufficiently like the word
Brittab tc be mistaken for it.

l. Pirst, we must remember that 'l'acitus's information came from
Germauy.

2, Next, that the word meaning Pruasioa was oct German. The
Germane got it from the Slavonians, and, consequently, were likely
tc confouud it with some more familiar term.

3. The word denoting Brit-tab was such a familiar term.

4. The adjectival termination was nearly the same in both lan·

gul'ghld preparas us for the evidence in favour ot' words at present sc

unlike as Preterion and Brtet ever haring been like.

'Phe first occurrence of the name of the modern kingdom ot' Proseis
occurs in Gaudentius, who accompanied Bishcp Adalbert to that
country between an. tet-1006.

Zeuss, from whom, as usual, 1 am taking my best facts, admits
that the term was Slavonic. “Der Name wird ruerat-ohne Zweifel
von Slawen gehdrt.”—p. 671.

Ηο also suggests that no argument against its antiquity is to be
taken from its being there recorded by a German for the first time.
