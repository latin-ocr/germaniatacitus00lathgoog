ΙΙ. If the common Lithuanic character of the Gothini and
Gothones be admitted, tha Getice of the Swedish district of
Gotbload may be considered.

When two populations of the samo name oecupy the op-
posite sides of a sea of moderate breadth‚ i is reasonable to
suppose they are branchos of the same stock.

Such is tho case with tha Goths of Gothland and the Go-
thones of (lourland.

This primd faeie view may, of course, be set aside by
certain facts.

Gertain facts aro against it here. These arc—

u. The present Norss character of the Swedes of Gothland.

b. The account of Jornaudes.

But (to set against this) the antiqnity of the Swedes of
Gothland is doubtful, and—

Thc account of J ornandos is improbable.

My own belief is that the population from whom the
Swedish province of Goth-land took the clement Gora, were
no more the N orse ancestors of its present occupante, than the
people from whom the county of Dor-set took the element
Dor·, were Angla-Saron 3 so that, just as the Dor· in Dor-set
was a Celtic root (Duuotriges) though -set was Saron, so was
the Gott- in Goth-land other than Norse though -hrad was
Norse.

a. No Scandinavian eume in any of the early writers-the
chief of these being Jornaudes—is more German than such
AngloSaxou words as Kentiay, or Dor-saet-oa‚· names of
which the second parts (day, and satan) ara Anglo·Saxon‚
but the first part (Kena, Dor-) Keltic, Caret-ii, Dur-otriges.

b. No tradition proves more than the derivation of the Brit-
ons from Brut, the grandson of Anchises; iu other wordS,
iactatis tractandis, Jornaudes takes the place of Geoffrcy of
Monrnouth.

o. No Germanic population is found with any form of the
root G-t, as its name, until it become an inhabitant of some
country so designated.
