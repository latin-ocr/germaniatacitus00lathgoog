through the foreste eud marshes, running from the mone es
far ns the river Lippe, and through westphalia, to the river
Weser. These reads were similar ιο the one between St.
Petemburg and Novgornd, and Moseow. Varus was led
by the conspiratura to abandun these straight roads, and as
he veutared deeper into the country. the revolt became gene-
ral, and the Romans found themselves outwitted. Varus
tried ιο retreat und renel· the causewuy, prohably with a
view of desendiug himself in the sortress os Aliso on the Lippe.

The question about the exact spot where the battle of
Varus was fought, is one os those which, in my opinion, cau

they were about to piteh their camp, the soldiers oould

by the consciousness of his hopeless situation and his respou—
sibility: aud he had several of his offieers put an end ta their
lives. It was probably at that moment that Numenius Vala
(apparently the person ιο whom Horace sddressed his epistle)
separated tho cavalry from tho inffintry, und endeavoured, but
unsnooessfully, to escape with his three squadrons alone. They
too were overwhelmed, just oe they deserved to be, for
