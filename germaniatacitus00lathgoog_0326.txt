sinos the langnages were wholly unknown, and the evidence they
supplied unappreciated.

Hence the test was less refined. As a consequence of this, what
we call U geion was, in the time of Tacitus, partly uias and partly
Sitoniaa.

1. The first was ths name where the physical conformation was
that of the lappas people to whom, at the present moment, the
term Fica ie limited by the scandinaviam of N orway and Sweden.

2. The second was that where the physical conformation was not
much different from that of the Germans ; and it comprised (probably
with many other sections) the Qvaem or Finlanders—whose bulk
and physical strength is by no means, palpably aud contrastedly,
inferior to that os the Swedes, Russians, and Lithuanians. Of these
the Sitones (or Quaene ol Finland) were the chief. l'acitus makes
them Ssoeui:; by Sueoic probably (but not indisputably) meaning
Sutorio.

Now the separation of what we now called Ugrians into the
Sitonians and Pinus is, in reality, the natural inferenoe from the
remarkable eontrast between the Ugrians of the Iapp type, and the
Ugrians ol the Finlandic ; a differenoe which existe at the present
moment as strongly as ever it could have done in the time os
Tacitus, a difference‚ too, which, ewen in the present days of ethno-
logical classifioation, has been osten overvalued. Hence, the separa· ⁶
tion os the Sitones from the Penni is no argument against the
former being Finlanders, de, Qooesu, properly so called, Finns os
Finland, improperly. It is just such a separation as many an
ethnologist would make now. 'Phe difference which it is most
important to remember is that between the words stn and Finn
os names—a differenoe which soe of England draw less definitely
than did Tacitus; or, at least, Tacitus’e informants.

⁴ Hellusios et OcioaaeJ-Upm the latter os these names I can
throw bnt little light On the former I can only remark the resem-

blance of their name to Ptolemy’sriwer mmm (Χαλοὺσος seraper)
and the Chali (Χάλοι).

But these aro in the parts about the Iaower lllbe, or the rivers of
Mechlenburg, or the Ilyder, or, perhaps, the Treve,· to the last of
which the name Chala-ma has been supposed to apply. Still, they
may be the parts to which Tacitus relers3 notwithstanding the fact
of the Hellusii being mentioned along with the Sitones and Finns
