λίγγιοι, εἶτα Κοὸονδοί· ὑπὲρ obe Χάλοι· καὶ ἔτι ὑπὲρ τούτους
δυσμικώτεροι μὲν Φουνδούσιοι, ἀνοτολικώτεροο δὲ Χοροῦδες,
πάντων δὲ ἀρκτικώτεροι Medma-Ptolemaei Germania.

Such is the evidence of those writers, Greek or Roman, who
deal with the local habitation of the Cimbri rather than with
the general history of that tribe. As a measure of the inde-
finitude of their ideas, we have the confusion, already noticed,
between the Cimbri and Cimmerii, on the parts of Diodorus,
Strabo and Plutarch. A better measure occurs in the follow·
ing extract from Pliny, who not only fixes the Cimbri in three
places at once, hut also (as far as we can find any meaning in
his language) removes them so far northward as Norway:
“Alterum genus lugaevones3 quorum pars Cimbri, Teutoni, ac
Chaucorum gentes. Proximi Rheno Istaevones; quorum pars
Cimbri mediterranei.'’—iv. 28. “ Promontorium Cimbrorum
excurrens in maria longe peninsulam efficit, quae Cartris appel-
latur.''-Ibid. 27. “ Sevo Mons (the mountain-chains of Nor-
way) immanem ad Cimbrorum usque promontorium efficit
sinum, qui Codanus vocatur, refertus insulis, quarum clarissima
Scaudinavia est, incomperta magnitudinis.”-Ibid. Upon
confusion like this it is not considered necessary to expend
further evidence. So few statements coincide, that under
all views there must be a misconception somewhere3 and of
such misconception great must the amount be, to become
more improbable than a national migration from Jutlaud ιο
Italy.

Over and above, however, this particular question of evi-
dence, there stands a second one; cir. the determination of
the ethuographical relations of thc natione under considera-
tiou. This is the point as to whether the Cimbri conquered
by Marius were Celts or (iotha, akin to the Gaulo, or akin to
the Germans3 a disputed point, and one which, for its own
sake only, were worth discussing, even at the expense of raising
a wholly independent question. Such, however, it is not. If
the Cimbri were Kelts‚ the improbability of their originating
in the Cimbric Chersonese would be increased, and with it the
amount of evidence required; since, laying aeide other consi·
derations, the natural unlikelihood of a large -area being tra-
versed by a mass of emigrante is greatly euhanced by the fact
