¹ Usipii.]—Another form 01 110 word is Usipi-ees.

lqnite agree with Zenss iu his suggestion, that this -et, is the
Keltic sign 01 the‘plural, and that this is the reason why it occurs in
Cesar throughout, whilst in Tacitus, it is the prevalent reading only
0000(1100. i. 51). ’

Oaesar's notice 01 110 Usipii takes precedeuce 01 011 others. He
places them 00 110 Lower Rhiue, making them contermiuous (or
nearly 00) with the Suevi, Sicambri, Tencteri, Ubii, 001 Bructeri.

The graver complicatione begin with the notice 01 Ptolemy. A
population with a name so like Usipii as Oti’rrrol, is placed by that
writer as far south as the frent-ier 01 110 Helvetian Desert-—that is,
we identify the two names. The necessity, however, for doing so is
doubtful. The name is, probably, Gallie.

2 faceti-The history 01 110 Tencteri is nearly that 01 110
Usipii, 001 vice cersd.

Pressed by the Snewi(0ltctti) they crossed the Rhine 3 were defeated ¹

by Caesar near the junction of the 11000 3 001 escaped, 00 01000001,
hy retracing their steps, and re·passing the Rhine to the country
01 110 Sigambri. A line drawn due east 01 Cologne, would pass
through the original country 01 110 Ubii, Tencteri, and Usipii.
They were Germane (1.0, 01 110 High German, cr 01110 Platt-
Deutsch division) rather than Saxone or Frisians.

According to Dion and Florus, Drusus conquered the Tencteri
001 Usipii ou his way to the Chatti, the latter being 00 110 northern
’1001101110 river Lippe. The complement 10 these two notes is
