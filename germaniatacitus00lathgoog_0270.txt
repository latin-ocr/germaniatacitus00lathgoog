which, we heve a place called Kienpcord ,· and as poord=hosoc in
Danisb, this is an additional clement in that quarter.

On the other hand the oompound kirre-effictorem, should
be notioed: as it shows, that, in tbut csse at least, the Danish name
is posterior ιο the introductiones Christianity. I do not remember
any such Frisian form ue Tjerk-um (the Frisian equivalent to
Kirkeby); a fact which gives ns negative evidence in favour oi the
antiqnity of the Frisisn names.

N creberet-For the square formed by lines drawn from Husnm
to sleswich, from Sleswick to Flensburg, from Blensburg ιο Leclr, and
from Lech ιο Rasum, there is only one place in am, Bordelosm, and
as this is on the right bank of the Tren, it may be considered as
belonging ιο the true Frisian crea3 being its most western locelity.
ltoughly speaking, the preponderating signs oi Frisian occupuncy
cesse when we pass tho Tren.

West of tbis line, and in the series oi angular projectione formed
by the Echemfjord, tbe Slie, the Flensborg Fjord, tbe Apenrade
Fjord, and the Hadersleren Fjord, we expect to find even fewer
Frisian names then we found in tbe centre of tbe peninsula Yet
such is not the case.

u Between the Ilclrernfiord and the sea is an Onu-am, snd a
Schwastr·om.

b. Between tbe Slie and the Fiensburg Biord is a wriem, und a
ansbolosna

c. Between the Flensburg and Apeurade Fiords is a Bell-um,
though quite at the western (north-western) extremity.

d. Between the Apenrade and Hederslewen Piords are Bodem
and Lygocm3 both on tbe eastern side.

In the parts necessary to fill up the vacancy, and comprise the
centro of North Sleswiclr, along with apert of South Jutland,
bounded by lines drawn from Leclr to Flcnsburg, from Flensburg to
Kolding, from Kolding to Ripe, from Bipe ιο Tondem, and from
T'ondern to Lech, we bave a few Frisian forms-Selli·urnhange, on
the south-east of Kolding, and opposite the isle of Fyen, being the
most eastern 3 south of wbicb, and also near the sen, is Stnbbom.

It ie scarcely necessary to say that the distribution of the Frisian
forms is remarkable.

Birst, we bave them to the exclusion of tbe Danisb and Platt·
Dentech ones.
