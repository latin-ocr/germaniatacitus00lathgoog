the mountain-sastnessea themselves were probably the residenoe ol
Slavonians.

I do not imagine that there was a second March in this quarter,

aa, one on the itoman (Rhatian, Vindelioian, or Rbmto-Vindelician)
frontier. rlhe Danube served instead.

Os course all this has the ralue of presumptive reasoning-no more.

⁴ ῥοπή-Τὼ area os the Quadi seems nearly to have reached
as far south as the present province of Louer Austria. This brings
them to the Danube, as the text of Tacitus requires-“anue
domania veltet frons est, qrmteous Danubio perpitur.'’ At the same
time, the line os the Germanic March must have been irregular, and
the Germanic area north os the Danube narrow. It must also
have extended as far northwards as Moravia and Upper Hungary.

Up ιο the time ol Tacitus, the political relations cl the Quadi are
chiefly with the confederacies of Maroboduus* Catualda, and the
Repetam Maeuianum.

Afterwards they are chiefly with the Sarmatians of Hungary.

Ι know no reasons, except astatement oi Ammianus as ιο their =
arms being like those ol' the Sarmatae, and the likelihood of the namo
Vuaat‘ue (petetis Quadorum) of the Repetunt Vanaiaaum being the
Slavonic title Poa=Dominua, for making them Sarmatian rather
than German. But these I think sufficient. Stin, as they are a
frontier population, the remark that applies ιο the Marsipai applies

to the Quadi also.
