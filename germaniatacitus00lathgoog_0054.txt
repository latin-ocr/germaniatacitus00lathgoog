PROLEGOMENA. XXXV

cerned, is scientifioally correct. What Tacitus baem of tha
Germana of the south was, that they extended as far down
the Danube as the frontier of Pannonia (say, the parts about
Pesth); and he had no reason to imagine that their southern
extension went one hair'shreadth further in an easterly
direction thau did their northern one ; οι· uico owed. Hence,
the extensiones their area, as far along the Baltic as it was
known to reach along the Danube, was legitimate: subject,
of course, to correction from further investigation; and
equally legitimate was the assumption that the Ligii aud
other populations of the intervening parts were German-since
the reasoning ran thus·-

α. The southern Germana run thus far eastwards.

b. The mum do the same.

o. So do the parts interjacent. Subject‚ Ι say, to correction
from absolute investigation this a priori view was strictly
scientifi03 and who shall say that Tacitus put it forth ancon-

Again-had the Baltic been even less German than it
actually was, it was only through Germane that it was known
to the Greeks and Romans: what, then, was mora natural
than that the extent of the German sea-board upon it should
be over-valuedi Like the present Danes with their occupancy
of the Sonnd, their prominence exceeded their occupancy.

These and similar considerations show that such inaccu-
racias aa we lind in Tacitus are, so far from subtracting from
his valna as an authority, or from the respect due to his tes·
timony, that they enhance his credit. Such as occur could
hardly have baeu avoided3 aud the only wonder is that there
are so few of them.

If, however, we deny this reasonable amount of inaccuracy,
the thoroughly hypothetica] character of the migratione in
question cannot be too strongly stated, or too prominently
exhibited. They are reforable to oue head, and to one head
only, via, the facts which they will explain. In and of
themselves they are wholly unsupported-unsupported with-
out, however, lying beyond the pale of observation. The
countries to which they appertain were known (at least)

well enough for Tacitus and others to write mulio The
