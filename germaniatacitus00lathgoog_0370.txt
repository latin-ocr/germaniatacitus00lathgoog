ment, I must anticipata a part of my inquiry. Good writers
hare identified those chdoas with the Gerenos Goths. As,
however, they by no means overlook the fact of the Gaddous
being Lithnanic, they must suppose that the name was
retained from that ef the earlier Goths subsequently replaced
by Litlruanians. In which case, the uewer inhabitants,
instead of retaining the name which they brought with them
from their own country, took that of the older population.

Now even in its most moderate form, this assumption is
considerably opposed to the usual course of ethnological
changes, or rather the usual course of ethnological changes is
opposed to it. In the first place, there are two cases of the
incorporated and amalgamated aborigines of a country taking
the name of their conquerere to one of the converse process.
Thus Franco takes its name from the German Franks, aad
Englaud from the German English, instead ol the Franks
taking their name from the Gauls, or the Augles from the
Britons. Still the converse takes place sometimes; and, as if
for the sake of invalidating the very connexion in question,
one of the best instaures of it is supplied hythe very district
under consideration. As far as any change took place at all
in respect to the conquerere of the parts abent the Lower
Vistula it was just the contrary to the particular instance
assumed to be the general rule. The German Prussians of
Prussia did take the name of the aboriginal Prae.

Now if the name Preterion were adopted by the conquerere,
who were really Germana, from the conquered, how unlikely
isit that the lower orders—the rural population of the agri-
cultural districts, pre-eminentlytenacious of nationality‚ who
were really Litbuanians‚ should adopt the name of any
previous Germane. In this respect, then, the assumption
that the term Gaddon is procl of the Gallenos being German
Getis is faulty.

Again-tlrat the term Geddoa eomes from Golden-is
generally admitted. Even, as it is, the preservation of it
is remarkable. But it becomes doubly remarkable if we
assume a total change of population to have taken place

between the time of its first application and the present.
