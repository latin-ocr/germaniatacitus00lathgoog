In favour ol a Slaronic affinity are :-

1. Their Slavonic character at the time they were first described
from personal knowledge. ·

2. The absence os any traces of a previous Germanic population in
the area occupied by them.

In other words, it is a certain fact that in the twelfth century

the Wamari were Slaronic, whilst the belief that the Varini were
German, is a reasonable, but not unexceptionable, inlercnce.
Probably, they were a frontier population.

⁶Eodcscs.]—One ol the tribes ol the Gimbric Chersoneso in
Ptolemy's list, is that of the Φουνδοΰσιοι. Here Ptolemy is wrong and
Tacitus right. Eudoses is the same word as Φουνδούσιοι, minsa
the Φ and ν. Such is Zeuss‘s view. To justify the first changes he
quotes the similar (supposed) mistalse, on the partos Ptolemy, in the
word Φαρόδεινοι. See note on Scardona.

The second is defended-and that reasonably-by the forms
Βονντοῡνται, Βρινξᾶντοι, Κέντιον ὄρος, and Βοινοχαῐμως in all of
which the ν is, undoubtedly, an improper interlin.

See Epileponwoa, ξ Plundusii.

⁷Saardoaes.]-Seo note on Eudoses.

This word is considered by Zeuss ιο be derised from the Moeso-
Gothic souird, AngloSaxon sweord=sword, just as saxon from selca
:lcnifa Hence, Tacitus's name is the correct one. On the other hand
Ptolemy places after tlte Saccas, aad oa tlte river Musa (perd dd
rode Σάξονος ἀπὸ τοῦ Xaltov'oov ποταμοῦ) the Pharoditti (Φοροδεινοί).

N ow the Φαροδ- of Φαροδεινοί, is, according to Zeuss, the Scard-
of Suessiones. Iam not prepared either to deny or affirm this.

⁸Nca'tltcaes.]-Zeuss’s reasoning [upon this word is remarkable,
but unsatisfactory. By an elaborate series ol' combinatione he derives
his own name from it. He assumes :—

l. That by the Nuithones Tacitus means the Testatus, the t being
changed into a. “ Aus Deutschland selbst geben Plinius und Ptole-
maeus noch die formen Teectoci, Teutones, aber auch schon Tacitus
Nuithones (=Niatltoccs) mit den wuraelhaftem a, wie N erthus.”

2. That Circam· a remarkable, and hitherto unexplained, form
in a document called the Wcssobrunner Manuscript, is the same as

ι See Epilcgomcnc‚§ Cincari.
