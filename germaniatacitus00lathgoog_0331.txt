iv annonantur or suerrus

Without admitting this, l have nothing better to pro-
pose; though, at times, I have thought that the ei, ste,
or sy, might=the eu- in Su-ssex, and the Sugambri:
Soutt Gambrians.

At other times, it has looked like the s-q, in the name of
the river Sicy5 so that Septembri = (lambrione os tle Sisy.

However, as long as there are fair reasons for believing it to
be no German word at 311, such guess·work is gratuitoua

The orthography of the name is varied. Although the

i be short-
“ Te caede gaudentes 5133131νὶ,
Compositis venerantur armis,''

the Greek form is Σουγάμὸροι, with the diphtlrong, ae in Stra-
bo; though Edyapd'poc in most MSS. of Ptolemy. The
best form, perhaps, is Sugambri.

The locality of the Sicambri is that of the Franks of the
Lower Rhine3 the question as to whether the Frank history
be 3 continuation of the Sicambriau, or the history ot'
another population on the same ground, being involved in
the questions just noticed‚ niz. the extent to which the dis-
appearance ol the name was nomiual or real; referable to
the extinction of the nation, or refersble to the displacement
of an old term bya new one; explained by the influence of
au army, or explained by the influence of a synonym.

And this question stands open.

Along with this should be taken from the following chap-
ter, the notice of the—
