unaltered-we have only to account for its permanencc.
Assume, however, a change, and you have an additional
complicatum since you have to account for its transfer as
well.

The present existence, then, of the term Getides: Go-
. tlon-is an argument, as far as it goes, against any change
of the original pdpulation3 or, changing the expression, the
supposed immigration of Lithuauians, aud displacement of
Germane, which has been shown to be improbable in itself‚
is rendered more so by the details that must be assumed if
we suppose that the Guddon took their name from any Gut-
tones who were German.

lu order to make the Gothiae as Lithuanic as the Gothum,
we must suppose one of two things, either that the former
were an outlying isolated section of the Lithuanic stock, or
that the intervening areas between the Gothiui and Go-
thones were Lithuanic. Are there any reasons against the
latter view-reasons against assuming the continuity of a
Lithuanic population from the Carpathiaus to the Baltic
(and nice ueraci), from the mere magnitude of the areat None.
The Lygian, which was parallel with it, is, in the samo
direction (from south to north), fully or nearly as large.

From the present distribution of the Lithuauian dialecto,
there are several ; but that these are¹ not insuperable, is shown
in the Prolegomcnu.

Ι do not, however, prees the point, since the approach of
the Gothini to the servile condition indicates the possibility
of their having been an outlying colony of captives.

All that Ι urge is the reference of the two (Gothini and
Gothones) to a common ethnological division (that division
being the Lithuauic), and the hypothesis which accounts for
the similarity of names.

I also urge the necessity of bringing the older Lithuauians
as far south as the parts just north of Gallicis, even if we
hesitate to continue them up to the very country of the
Gotlrnnes.

For clear aud definite history,—aud we must remember
that history for these parts begins but little before the twellth
century— brings a Lithuauian population as far iu the direc-
