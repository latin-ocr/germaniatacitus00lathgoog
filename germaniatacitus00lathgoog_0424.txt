Pliny's evidence is the earliest. He places them on the
Baltic rather than elsewhere. ‘¹ Nee minor opinione Eniugin.

The first eomplicntion here oceurring, is the similarity of
the names ffim' and Scir-i. Strange that mally different
populations, with numen ιο nlike. should oeeupy contignoue
lnmlities. No other writer mentions the Hirri, und I think
they ure but Scir-i under another name—is„ ι nnn-ie taken
frum a different dialect.

Neitlner dees uuy other writer place my Scir-i in tlie north.

The Olbian Inscription mentions the Σκίροι, along with
the Γάλα-ναι.

Stephnnus Byzantinus speaks of Σκίρυι, ruhi-mem« ἔθνυς.

Procopius joina the Σκίροι with tha Gnths and Alana.

Jornmdes mentions the Scir-i us either subjecte οι· allies

difficulties that even the assumption of migratious will not
wceount for: since, although n movemeut from the Bultie
to the Danube, between the time of Pliny and Prowpius,
will account for their presence on thaz river, it is of no nvail
for the Scin* of the Olbian luscription—whieh is generally
referred lo a period anterior tu tha time ns Pliny, ix„ the
first nr second century mc.

Sidonius mul-ree the Scin· part of Attila’n army.

Now, ae we are much snrer os the Seiri of Jornnndes on
the Danube, than of those of Pliny, their ethnology will be
considered first.
