reason against the Aviones having been Frisisns, bnt no
resson against their having beon Old Snxons.

But ugninst this is Ptolemy's name Κοὲανδοί, snrl the
Kossarsol lie northwards.

3. whether the Eudone ste the samo ns the Φοννδοιὶινιοι
(see not* in § xi..) is not a matter ofindifferenea. By identifying
them, we noemin the directim», if not the exact locality of
the Eudone. Thia is northman-dn, in the western part of the
Cimbric Peninsnln.

4. whether the διακόψαι ιη the same as tho Φαρύ-
&wei (ses notin § xi..) is still less nmstter of indifferent-e. By
idontisying them wo mertsin the direction, if not the exact
loeality, of the Sum-dom. This is wodwarde between the
*Su-dms und ths Olialmuo (Oder- Γ snd Trnve Ζ). But thou we
get n complicantium since Suara- is generally considered to
be a German root, whereas the lnoelity is Slsvuninn.

Time S>rd is really a German root is tendered probable by
the form Swoord—waere in the Traveller's song. But this only
makes it a German gloss. Thnt it applied to a German
populntion by no manns follows. Nn word is muro German
than Welsh, few populations less so.

5. 1n the name Μωρέ, the Raud- may, possibly, be the
Hres„ in Erum-Gutum. Now the Erat-Gom were Lithu-
81111113.

6. On the Nuithones 1 ean tiu-ow no light st alh—not even
in tho way of μακε-ποτὶ and suggestion.

If wo leave Tacitus und betsko ourselvas to Ptolemy, we
gain a little. In Ptolemy wo not only get the names of
certain populations, bnt we get their locality (or nt least
their dii-oetion) also. But they nte almost all new⁴ aud othei·-
wise unknown. Siquloun. Sabiln'nyn‘i, ebali.

Upon the whole, Ῑ think that the Angli of Tacitus were tho
only representatives, ennmernted hy him, of the Anqlo-Suon
hem-eh of the Saxone—unless tlte Nuithones be n semna.

Of the others, Ῑ think that :—

α. thrs their direction was ensterly, they were flla-
vomam.

h. Whore it was northerly, Eritium, or mammiano,—
Frisium in the north-west, Slnvoninns in tho north-san.
