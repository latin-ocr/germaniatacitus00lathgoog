cxxviii rae ceantur or monus.

If so, (lber-arei is an adjective, and the -se is the -rc in
Brittise‚ the ek· in Dan-sko, and the -ielr in sels-iet.

lfao, the population to whom it applied, must have called
themselves hyan orbatiool appellation; and this is no more
than the present Danea and Sweder do‚—Dan·rke‚ sven-eka.

if so, the -d is omitted; and this is no more than what
occurs in the form Nor-ake, from Nor-d-ske,-the fuller lorm
being Horredske or Claudite.

In Beowulf and the Traveller's Song, we lind mention
of a town with a palace in it, called Heerot.

Near this liceret, the Hectit-dardos were defeated; a
population at no great distance from the Anglee-probably
either the Barda of Bardmwie, or the Langobards of Tacitus.

Except that the Hertz is a mountain-range rather than a
town, Heerot=Hortz, of which it is the Low German serm.

I also think it was the country of the Herodes. Alco, of
the Proper Oderunt—though, l admit, that it carries them
asfar eastasitis saleto do.

Hence, l consider that the Heredes were the Oteneei
in the most limited sense of the term, and the Old Saxona
the Cherusci in the widest3 the one name being that by
which they were known to their western, the other that by
which they were known to their eastern neighbours; and,
although their political extinction is doubtful, their diminished
importance (noticed by Tacitus) may have favoured the sub-
stitution of one name for another.

The following linesjustify ns in placing the Cherusci so lar
eastward as has been done:

Venit accole silue
Bructerus Hercynia), latisque paludibus exit
Cimber et ingentes Albim liquere Cherusci.
Accipit ille preces varias, tardeque rogatus

Annuit et magno pacem pro munere donat.
Claud. De ir. Cous. Houor. 450.

The Ghernsci were part of the Eaatphalians (ospitat-i) of
not. in v. Angriuarii.

But Ptolemy places the Harudes in the Cimbric Cher-
soneae‚ and so (perhaps) does Beowulf. This is a grave
objection to the previous doctrine.
