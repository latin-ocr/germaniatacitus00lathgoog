cvl THE cauum 01³ uacuus.

The best evidence of their being Germanis that of the
names of their leaders3 but such evidence would make the
Spaniards who fought under Wallt'uytoa, Englishmen.

But what if we find Vacci on the Rhine, a comparatively
northern localityl The most that follows from this is a
doubt as to which of the two nearly synonymous populations

ξιον were—Auarcae' of the Vistula, or Varini of the Lower
lbe.

What if we find them in connection with the Acyta? This
helps us in the decision, and inclines us to prefer the Varini,-
but it by no means proves connection.

But what if they be Aaplaa in Thuringial This, again,
only makes ns pausa in deciding which Ακρὶαο are meant.

lt never touches the connection.
What if we lind thern in contact with the Danesl This

deuotes that the particular V·r-a· thus described were Varini.
But what if Ποαι--Βαοὶἓ * This throws us back on the
Aoorwti.

Nothing, however, touches the connection. lt is only the
details that are complicated: details which are just as diffi-
cult, whether we suppose amigration or not.

All this really happens, as may be seen by comparing the
following extract with the Epilepowwnc, §§xn1.andxn11.:-
Οὔαρνοι μὲν ὑπὲρ Ἴστρον ποταμὸν ἵδρυνται, διήκουσι δὲ
ἄχρι τε ἐς Ὠκεανὸν τὸν ἀρκτῷον καὶ ποταμὸν Ῥῆνον, ὅσπερ
αὐτούς τε διορίζει καὶ Φράγγους καὶ τᾶλλα ἔθνη, ἃταύτῃ
ἵδρυνται. Οὗτοι ἅπαντες, ὅσοι τὸ παλαιὸν ἀμφὶ Ῥῆνον
ἑκατέρωθεν ποταμὸν ᾤκηντο, ἰδίου μέν τινος ὀνόματος ἔκαστοι
μετελάυχανον . . . ἐπὶ κοινῆς δε Γερμανοὶ ἐκαλοῦντο ἅπαντες
. . Οὔαρνοι δὲ καὶ Φρόνγγοι τουτὶ μόνον τοῦ Ῥήνου τὸ ὕδωρ
μεταξὺ ἔχουσιν-Ρωοορ. Bell. Goth. iv. 20.

Again, Ἔρουλοι . . ἔρημον δὲ χώραν διαδόντες ἐνθένδε
πολλὴν ἐς τοὺς Οὐάρνους καλουμένους ἐχώρησαν. Μεθ’ οὓς

δὴ καὶ Δανῶν τὰ ἔθνη παρέδραμον-ΡωοομΒοΠ. Goth. ii. 15.

Lastly, Procopius relatas that an Ακρῖα princess was be·
trothad to Radiger, the prince of the Vacci—The Saxona
in England‚ i. 23.
