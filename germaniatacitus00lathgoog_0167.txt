Far ιοο many inquirere either adopt or acquiesce in the current

notion that migratione are phenomena, which wc may msume ιο any
extent required, not only on account ol the facts demanding explana·
tion, but in order to sustain the accuracy ol even indifferent authors.
. Το euchitis as easy ιο bring a population from the Baltio to the
Mediterranean, across a whole series os hostile countries, as to move
a knight across a cheae-board. The grem name of Niebuhr justifies
this gratuitous prodigality of locomotion. Nay more, it seems so
philosophie ιο trace a so-called national movement tc its primary
cause, that a known invasion in one quarter is oiben supposed ιο
justiiy the assumption ol an unknown onc elsewhere-so that
natione prees each other sorwards, themselves being pressed upon.
This doctrine, with metaphora and illustratione ιο match, is plausible
enough ιο ba widely recognised.

It means, in its naked form, that a attacks n, because he cannot
support himself against c, ο being similarly situated in respect ιο
mand so on ς aview which makes the great qualification sor tha
attack oi another nation's country, the inability ιο defend one's
own.

This doctrine we would gladly believe ιο be true. Ιι would
diminish by nine-tenths the crimes oi the warlike part ci the human
species. It would reduce all but the first primary movemeuts toa
matter of necessity, and so justiiy them. The motives ior aggres-
sion would not be envy, cruelty, and cupidity, but the unpleasant
necessity oi choosing between reparation for what has been lost to
yourself by tha appropriation of what belongs tc another, and death
or bondage.

A little analysis, and a few distinctions, will show that, instead of
migratione being thus common, they are eminently rare. Ἴ

Amiprctioc is different srorn amere extension ol frontier. No
one says, that when the whole American population premes west
warda, at the rate of (say) twelvc miles a year, there is a migration.
Tho frontier has been advanced3 the advancing population being
continuom with the stationary, and no separation cl ona portion ol
tha American population from another having taken place. The
Russians are gradually encroaching upon the Siberians 3 and the
English on the Welsh ; yet ncne cf these are inatances of migration.

A migration ie different from a return, or rc-migration. No
