them, and, consequently, leave behind them no means of pre-
serving traces of their previous existence.

History only tells usos German armies having advanced
southwards. The conversion of these armico into aotiwml
migratione is gratuitous.

But if the area ol the dispoasessed Germane was thus
remarkable, that of those who held their ground was not
less eo.

Along the Danube there was, at the time of Tacitus, a
real existence of Germana to the south of Bohemia and
Manavia, and it extended so far eastwards as to come within
the same degree of longitude as the supposed Gotho of the
Baltic. The Germano of the Danube were the Marcomanni;
perhaps the Quadi; and almost certainly, some of the ances-
tors and vaunt·couriers of the Goths of Moesia in the third
century.

Now these kept their ground, being the only ones that are
admitted to have done so. They did more ; they encroached
permanently on their neighbours to the east. Strange, that
the laet of lying south of a given degree of latitudo, should
thus have preserved those Germana of the Danube against
those fierce Slavonians who (if we suppose the Lygii to have
been Germane, and the Marcomanni to have occupied all
Bohemia) so thoroughly exterminated their brethren to the
north. It looks as if the fact of their having been personally
engaged in warfaru against Rome, had so sharpened their
swords as to have endowed them with powers of resistance
unknown north of the Bohemian frontier. Everywhere else
the Germana retired3 between Bohemia and the Danube
they encroached.

Yet it was not for want of enemies that they thus kept
their ground. Theirs was no locality especially favoured by
peace. They had the same Slavonians to contend with that
extinguished the supposed Germane of the Oder and Vistula,
and they had the Romans as well. It is not strange that the
ancestors of the Ostrogoths and Visigoths should have held

out against these odds. It is strange that thoy should have
been the only Germans who did so. Surely this is apage
in history which may be read differently; aud instead of
