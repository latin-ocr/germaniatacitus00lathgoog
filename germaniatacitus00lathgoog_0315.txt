the coast changes suddenly from east ιο north; so much so as to
make the parts in question, for some time, the mest eastern extre-
mity os the Baltic. From Memel to Windau, the navigation is due
north, and it is only by keeping along the coast that the Guls of
Riga is found to form a bend towards the east. The Gulf of Fiu-
land does se still more. But this isonlyforawhile. Finland itsels
is nearly in the same longitude with Gourland.

Unless, then, ve take in the Gulfs os Riga and Finlaud, the
country of the AEstii is really the eastend of the Baltic

Furthermore-except for the purposes ol a special trade, the
gulfs in question were not likely to be visited ; since from the
position of the islanda Oesel and Dago, at the entrance of the Gulf
cf Riga, and the narrowness of the entrance of the Gulf of Fin-
land, it was not necessary for even the most cautious ceasters to
follow the linc of the land, on a voyage from Memel in Courland to
Abo in Finland.

Itis likely, then, that those Germans, who applied the term AEstii
to the Courlanders, made uo account of the Gulfs of Riga and Fin-
land 3 iu which cases the Curhche Νώνιος was rightly designated
as cautem, κατ’ ε’ξόχην.

We, however, who do make account of those great indentations,
placed our Euat-men in Esthonia.

The quotation alluded to is one from Stephanus Byzantinus-
’ssorr'orvcc‚ ἔθνος παρὰ τῷ δυτικῷ ὠκεανῷ οὓς Κ οσσίνοος Ἀρτεμίδωρός
φησι, Πυθέας 'nataeve

Pytheas is the voyager, whose account ef the Baltic about 320
rae. is treated with some contempt by Strabo-i. p. 63.

However, it by no means follows that because the name was
Gothic it applied to a Gothic population 3 indeed, as far as we cau
get evidence for a negative fact, it is against the word AEstii being
a native name.

There is plenty of mention between the time of Tacitus and the
eleventh century of these same AEstt'i ,· but it is only by writers who
were themselves either Germans or adopters of the German geograpby
that the name is Hert, sliat, or some similar form.

General, however, as the name is in the Germanic authorities, is
it rare in those of Russia, Prussia, Poland‘l Probably, it is not to
be seund at all. Instead, thereos, we have the term Prusa (Prusian)
or the more remarkable form Gssddon.

These remarks upon the form and origines the word have been
