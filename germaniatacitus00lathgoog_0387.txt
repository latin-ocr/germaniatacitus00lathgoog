gundy, along with the Frank character of tlre (geogra-
phically) Burgundiau Merovingians, give the chief reason
for believiug that those tribes who were politicelly Franks
of the Upper Rhine, were peoyrcplicclly aud ethnohye’cally
Burgundians, at least for the middle portion of them. The
southern members of this group were probably Suevian, the
northern Hessiau.

Again—the relations of the Burgundian Guuther to the
Frank Sigt'rid, in the traditions emhodied in the Nibelungeu
Lied connect the two.

ΙΙ. The Fracte os tle northern frenetica—The chief tribes
who, ethuologically, formed this district were, as long as
the early name (the name by which they were known to the
Gauls) preponderated, Sicambri. Iu detail, they were Gam-
drc'ee‘r‘, Marsi, (luperci, and, probably, Ubii, Uer‘pia aud

When known as Germana, the collective name was out
of place3 since Tiberius, Drusus, and the other conquerors of
the Lower Ruina, had not so much to deal with Genusus
as opposed to Gauls. as with Germana as opposed to each
ctlrer. Hence came the less necessity for a collective name,
and the greater necessity for a number of specillo oues. The
Sicarndre' of the Gcnls are now the Bructeri, Tubantes, hc,
of the Germana.

When the necessity for the distinction between the de-
pendent Germana of the Roman territory, aud the free
Germaus of the frontier (March) became necessary, the
necessity of a general name came iu again. This general
name was Frank. The Franks of the Lower Rhine seem tc
have been chiefly Platt-Deutsch, though, partially, Old Saxou
and Frisiau as well.
