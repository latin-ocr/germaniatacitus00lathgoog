So that to derive the German, Slavonic, Lithuanic,
Greek and Latin from India, is to derive the greater hom the
less, the multiform from the simple, the admitted from the

doubtful. lt is to deduce the stock from the offshoot, to
move the earth with a lever in the clauda*

All such connectione as that between the Sanskrit aud

Ι Ι must be allowed to remind the reader that from a desire to deal with
the question as a questiones logie only, and with the wish to rmderstate,
rather than oneratam, my case, Ι argue entirely er abundanti.

Thus-

a. Ι allow the Vcdas to be four thousand years old—without bellering
an thing of the kind.

(hl allow the Hindu, Bcngali‚ Urdu, Gujerati‚ Mahratta, and modern
Persian tongues, to be aa trnly Sanskritic in origin as the English is Angla-
Saxon-without belicving it.

c. Ι allow thc Armenian to be Indo-European.

d. Also the Ossetic. The only laets respecting these last three points
which Ι argue from, is the existence of doubts-not the validity of them.

e. Ι lay no stress on thc statement that the third languagc ol thc cunci-
lorm inscription is other than Indo-European.

s Ι carry the traces of a Tamulian tangue, anterior to the Hindu, no
further south than the parts about Bombay-

g. And the traces of monosyllabic tongues, similarly anterior to the
Sanskrit‚ no further south than the Lower Ganges.

h. Ι allow the Siaposh to be as Sanskritic as the most extreme defendere
of its Sanshritic origin make it, and Ι place the Lughmani, aad other
dialectS, as well as the Pusti‘r ol Affghanistam in the same category.

ι’. Ι lay no strcss on the Tamulian character of the Brahrii, the numerals
of which were admitted by Lassen to bc those of Southcru India.

On the other hand-

As Ι take exceptione to the lado-European character ol the Keltic

ν· tongues, and although 1 am, perhapS, the only philologist who does, Ι take

no advantage of the current opinion, by which the contrast between the
differcnccs between the so-called Indo-Europcan tongues ol' Europe and the
comparative homogeneousness ol those of Asia would be heightened.

Ι wish to reduce the question to its logical form which is, that where roe
lacerno branellae ostie rame division qs speech separated from each other, one
os which ir the lorger in areo aad the neore diversified sy voriclies, aad the otha·
smaller and eomparotinely homogcneoua, tle presumption ia in saecat ‘ff the
latter being derioed from the sermm, rather than the former froin the latter.
To deduce the IndoEuropcans of Europe lrorn the Indo-Europeans ol Asia,
in ethnology, is like deriving the reptiles of Grect Britain from those ol'
lreland in erpetology.
