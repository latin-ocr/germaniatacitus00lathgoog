At one time Ι was inclined wholly to disconnect the name
Araplos with thoringiam· holding that it meant the Angla (or
coola) cs aad, and was, simply, a geographical term misunder-
stood. Since theu, however, Ι have been in the country, and
found that there is a second Asyla district to the south of
Lech, and in the Frisian count-ry3 a fact which invalidates
the previous view.

But, even if this be granted, it is only evidence to the fact
of there being Angles in Sleswick at tlcc time chsda3 and
then they arc in the Slavonic part ol the island, on the Baltie
side of it, and in an area no larger than the county of Rut-

which was Frisian to the west, aud Slavouic to the east.

Still the question is one of great magnitude and numerous
