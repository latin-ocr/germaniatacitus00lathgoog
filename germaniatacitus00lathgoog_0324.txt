noras ou securos xuvr. 177

lt is just possible that the Bastamae were Germane-not thatI
mean by thie that the proper area of ths Germane reached so sar as
Thrace and hlcesia, the Bastarnis locality, but that the Germane ol
the Danube, might have begun their encroachmente in an easterly
directicn thus early, aud have reached thus lar. 'l'hey might have
been immotos Germana in the quarters where Livy places them.

But it ie far from being certain that even this supposition is
necessary. Strabo’s statement merely goes ιο their exhibiting Ger·
man characteristica, and having Germane in their neighbourhood.
Pliny is rarely to be tehen as an independent witness. Tacitus
speaks explicitly as to the most characteristic lacts3 yet doubts as
ιο tha infereme from them. In one point he is either wrong or in·
explicable. If sede mean pmyrapbical position, his statement is
wholly incompatible with all that writers say about the locality
ol tha Bastarna (on ths Lower Danube), and the limite cl his own
omnia.

Ithinlr we may sefely say that, in the passage of Strabo which
makes the Bastarna German, there is aqualifying expression cs doubt,
and in that ol 'lacitus doubt and unsatisfactory language as well.

λ Befsreuce to other writers increases rather thau diminishes the
complicatione

Livy's evidence makes them &aab ,· since he calls their leader in
one place Clondicus dux Bastomcrum (xl. 68) and in another
(applying to the same series ci events) Clondicus, regulus θαῑὶανααα
(xliv. 26).

He also writes-“ Per Scordiscos iterasse ad mare Hadriaticum
Italiamque. Alia via traduci exercitum non possa. Facile Bas-
tarnis Scordiscos iter daturos ; nec enim aut lingua aut moribus
aquales abhorrere.'’

Now whenever the Scordisci are referred to any of the recog·
nized divisione cf antiquity, they are called Γαλάται, or Galli-
whether rightly or wrongly ie another question.

Plutarch does tha same es Livy-'Yssslres δὲ (nempe Perseus) καὶ
Γαλάτας, τούς περὶ τὸνἿατρον οἰκημένους, οἳ Βαστάρναι καλοῦνται.-

Vit. Paul AEmil. c. 9.

nhc Bastarna were distinguished from their neighbours-warlike
as these were-by superior bravery, vast statura, aud intense lore of
fighting—'Ardpsc ὑψηλοὶ μὲν τὰ σώματα, θαυμαστοὶ δι’ rdc prbi-ar,
μεγάλαυχοι δι’ καὶ λαμπροὶ ταῖς κατὰ τῶν πολεμίων ἁπαλοῖο-ΗΜ.

Vit. Paul. AEmil. 12.
