worshippers ol* Tmo Mater, would have pus-ed for ontlying
Frisium, ontlying chauci, or outlying Cherusci: for anything
mum thau the representntives uf s separate substantive
brnnch of the great Saxum or Frisian, or Saxo-Frisiun
division os the Germanic tougus.

ssiu the Anqli represent; hut how far they do so simpla
hsndod, or how fur the Eudoxa ond other populations of § xi..
do the sume, is uncertain.

1 think they do not dn so exuntly.

l. To begin with the Varini, whose relations to ths Anyti,
u ulrendy hss been indicated, ure eminently difficult—

Ths mention ot* them slong with the Anyti„ is s presump—
tion that they were whst the Anyhs were.

Their wmmou worship of the goddess Hor-tha is s specifio
fact: and if it were n sset beyond doubt. there would he no
fuir reasons sor reiining on the untursl inserenoe from the text
of Tacitum in other words. although there would still bs s
bslnnoe of oonllieting difficulties. the evidence of a German
object of worship, with s German nume, in u German island,
would outweigh tho presumption arising from the Wamavi
of authentis history being nnequivooally Slnvonic.

But the fact is not beyond impendi-neum since we can lind
the elements of a noturol and exensuhlo error in ths peonliur
character os the culm of the Angli on une side, and the
Varini on the other⁴

Xtht if the Varini had one lwly island, and the Anqlt'
another—so that the imula sacra, with their eorrespouding
casta nemora, were two in number. Ῑ submit that s writer,
vrith no better mos-ns of knowing the sxuet trnth than Tacitus,
might, in such s ense, when he recognized the ζωνῶν chamo-
ter common to the two forms of aalma, easily und pnrdonnhly,
refer them to oue und the sume island: in other words, he
might know the general fact that the Anffli and Vam'm'
worshipped in nn island, without hnuwing the particular fact
os their ench having u separate ons.

This is whst really happened: so that thu hypothesis is us
follows :—

a. The trnly und undoubtedly Gsrmnnic Anqli worshipped
in Heligolnnd.
