§ ιιι. m« τει mou nr mumana-

The heading os a body of lawa os, perhaps, the tenth
century, is, Incipis Lm Anqlmm et Wfflnonm, hoo ut ΤΙΜ-
ΜΞᾝζῃωιῑοω aql-‘ao οι Qui„ a· ι Thuringim σωκ
W—

§xum un 'nn mnu οι Tuumou.

This must be read along with §§ xv.. and ιιι.

The Wmu was a river of Thuringia, which it dividerl from
Suony.

a. Uales- we suppose either that the river Wamow effeeted
n migration-

b. Or that it took its nume from the Van'ui, who did so—

σ. 01· that there was n ouloniul seulement—

We must suppose that the populatiou book its name from tho
river, that Wnn'm' mee-ut the people of tho Wma, and that
the two populations ware ns uumnneeted aa the two rivers.

But the names of different rivers being no like. u Worra is
ιο Warnow, ia agaim the chaneos.

And the tvo Δηρὼ locslitisn ιη so aa well.

And the eontignity of the Angla „fehe Eum ω ιιι. Varini,
taken with thaz of the Angles of 'thuringia to the Werini,
is still more w.

still the names of the rivers nm facts which we must take
m we find ; since the circumstance of a river taking its nume
from its oeenpauts is ns mre aa the convene is common,
vspecinlly mangot the Slnvnnie populations.

Evon if we assume n eolonintion like that of the Chamavi
and Chattuarii, the difficulty is only dimiuizhede uince it
would still be stu-unge that the people of the War-now should
be removed ω a loonlity with a name so near their own ns
the Wem.

ΨΜ may possibly, like ΟΜ und Anam, have been n
name that, from being n common rather than n μψστ one,
meurs in different places.

Stin, the difficulty of the relation of the Aayh' und Worini
