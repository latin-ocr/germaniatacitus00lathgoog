It is not impossible thul the first two Amhrmm may be the
same people, ia„ both Saxone of Britain, rather than British
saxone, in the first ease, und German Saxone (ne the true Old
Saxeus were) in the second; since there is some difficulty in
believing nn nrchbiehop of York to have been employed so

This makes it look aa if the Ligurian Ambmm were such
formidable robbers us to have made their name synonymous
with plauderet—for, it must be observed that Plutarch says
that they called themselves what Festus says their neighboure
