Tha hypothesis respecting the Saxon- iu aa follow: :—

The name Sam was to the Kolta of Britain, what Ger-
man was to those of G-nul.

Or, it· not, what Sum* was—a nume somewhnt more
specific.

It probably applied to the Germana of the sen—coast, and
the water-systema of the Lower Rhine, ΨΜ, Lower Elbe,
and Eyder; to Low Germana nn the Ehine, to Frisium md
Saxons on the Elbo. aad to North Fu‘siaus on the Eyder,

All the Angles were Saxona, but all tha Saxona were not
Angles⁴

The reasoning in &went of this view is ns follows :—

That Sam πη a Britannia term Ξε undanied. The
Welsh and Guels eall us δαισιν at the present moment.

The Romanu would take their name fur certain Germana,
u they found it with the Britons.

The Erimus md Romans using the nme name, would be
ns two bo ohe in favour of the Keltie name taking gmund.
It would he the Renum md Keltie against a German name
singlffihnnded.

'rba orssy question is, whether the name Samon was wola-
n'voly Briunnie (Keltie), ¹2⁶„ not German also.

In favouk of the word being German, are two taeta—

1. The thorough adoption of the root Hm, as denoted
not only by the use of German writers. but by itu appear—
ance in Eam, ΨΜ, Suo-xx, Mfflh-m‚ The reason—
iug that applico ω Smi, applica here.

2. The name δαω-ιιεοῑ, ω a deity, whom the Old Saxona,
on their eonvenion to Christianity, were eompelled to for-
flwear. This gives un the likelihood of its being the nume of
an φωψηνιιε. 1 admit that this is copone. but not that it is
eoneluflive.

3. The story about ”inuh amoro Savac=lako ,your dayyen,
aad the deductim· from it, that Πάνσα meant down-mon. isos
uo great weight: with the pre-ent writer at lenut. stin, ns
far as it goes, it is something.
