At what time the name first became an nuequivocal
geographioal designation* of what now, iu the way of politius,
coincides with the Grand Duohy ol Baden and part of Wur-
temburg, and, in respect to its physion} geography, is part of the
Black Forest, is uncertain. It was not, however, later than
the reign of Alexander Severus (ending nn. stat-the Ta·
bula Peutingeriana being supposed to be referablo to that
date. Therein, Annnnurnn and Suuvru appeartogether—
as terms for that part of Germany which had previously
gone under the name of Decumates cyri, and the parts about
the less Itmnonas.

With this, then, begins the history of the duaci of itachia,
or, rather, of the Scationa. Their allianoas were chiefly
with the Alamanni and Burgundians; their theatra the Ger·
man sido of Franoe, Switzerland, Italy, and (in conjunction
with the Visigoths) Spain. Their epoch is from the reign
of Alexander to that of Augustulus, in round numbers, from
about nn. 225 to nn. 475, a period of two hundred and
fifty years.

Their nusciosum amount ol historioal prominenoe was the
time when Ricimer the Sounion, and Gundobald the Burgum-
dt'on, made and unmade snoh emperors as Severus and Oly-
brius, the immediate predecessore ol Augustulus.

Now is the time to take a measure of the extent to which
the notion† that Susu- roos no sotios saman term ut au,
but a Kcltic aomo adopted dy tls Romans, is a paradox, or
aprobable inferenoe from the early notioes of the populations
sooalled.

or not. It is known to have been so.

⁶2. Nor is there macl doubt about its having been hom
the Gauls that the Romans took it: since it was probably
Gauls from whom Oaesar learned tho names of the allies aud
subjeots of Ariovistus.

'⁵ Niebuhr mentions un inscription notioiug a Victoria Soccus in the
reign of Nerva. But thero is no evidence of this having been n victory
ovor tho Saevi of Suelio. Cassur’s victory over the Saevi of Ariovistus was

a Victoria Sucuico, but no victory over the pooplo ol tho Danuuium agri.
