Die stat ward genennt auch lisama*
N ach der abgdttin, das was der pris.

Der tempel als lang stuond unversert
Bis im von alter was der val beschert.
Und da er von alter abgieng

Der berg namen von im empfieng 3

Daruf gestanden was das werck,
Und haist noch hiit der licenter-ck?

“ They built a great temple therein,
To the honour of Ziae the heathen goddess
thm they after heathen customs
Worshipped at that time ;
The city was named else Ztsoras
Alter the heathcn goddess, that was its glory.
The temple long stood entire
Until its fall was caused by age.
And when it from age wentoff
'l'he hill took the name from it;
Whereon the work stood,
And still hight Zoenurp.‘’

Confirmatory of this is an extract from the Augeburg Chronicle,
and, of equal valna is a fragment preserved in two MSS, one from
Munich, and one from the monastery os St. Emmeram, wherein we
find a passage, accompanied by marginal notes, headed “ Excerpta
ex Gallica Historia.”

These are too lengthy for quotation, besides which, they are to
be found in full in the D. Μ. pp. 260-2? 2.

They agree, however, in containing, amongst much inaccurate
and distorted history, the special statement that the parts in
question were the head-quarters of the osellae of the Dec Casa.
“ Quam religiosissime colebant, cujus templum quoque ex lignis
barbarico ritu constructum, postquam eo colonia Romana deducta
est, inviolatum permansit, ac vetustate collapsum nomen colli ser·
vavit. Quinquagesimo nono die, qua eo ventum est, curn is dies
Dcoe Cim, apud barbaros celeberrimus, ludum ac lasciviam magis
quam formidinem ostentaret,” &c
