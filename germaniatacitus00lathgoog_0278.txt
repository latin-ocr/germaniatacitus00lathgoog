Strabo, Velleius Paterculus, all speali 31 the Cherusci, and all say
nothing about tbe Saxone. Ptolemy, 3313 well known, is the first
writer who mentions them. On the other hand Claudian is the last
writer in whom we find the word Cherusci.

—venit accola silrae
Bructerus Hercyniae, latisque paludibus exit
Cimber, 31 ingentes Albin liquere Cherusci.
Consul. ir. Honor. 450.

As long as we have the Cherusci there are no Saxona As soon
as we meet with the Saxone the Cherusci disappear.

If we wish to cut the Gordian knot, we can hare recourse to the
assumption 31 migratiou and displacement-in which the Old Saxone
cesse to he the descendants 31 the Cherusci and their allier, and re·
present 3 new and intrusire populationes foreign to the old Che-
333333 country of Cermany as they were to that 31 the Britons.
There are certain texts that encourage this view, eg, the present
notice of the fallen state of the Cherusci and Fosi is in favour of their
being easily displaced and superseded by some more flourisbing im-
migrante.

Valeat quomam. It only does half the business. lt only extin-
guishee the Cherusci. The presence and preponderance 31 the
Saxone it leaves unexplained.

The full impert ol this must be admitted.

c. The Saxone, which by assumption are supposed to replace the
Cbemsci, cannot be got lrom the country 31 the Chatti. The Chatti
were High Germane.

b. Nor yet from that of the Chauci. The majority of the Chauci
were Frisians.

c. Nor yet from that 31 the Lower Rhine. The language here
was PlattDeutsch.

More than this-they could not bave come from any small or in·
considerable country 31 311, from 333331 the nooks or cornere
between the Creat Frisian, PlattDeutsoh, High German, 3331813-
ronic areas. The differences between the Anglo-Saxou and Old
Saxou dialecto, show that the common language was spoken over 3
large tract of ground, and that 133 3 considerable length of time.

The assumption 313 Saxon immigration into the Cherusean terri·
tory, is 331 only gratuitous, hut it engendsrs as many difficulties as

it remores.
