a form of the Gothic speech nearer our own language than either
the Dutch of Hollnnd, the Scandinavian dialects, or the High German.

In another new and peculiar point of view, the Frisians claim
notice. Their history is, to a certain extent, a physical history.
Many branches of the stem to which they belong have been lopped
off hythe hand of man, by war, by famine, by oppression bravely
withstocd. But others have given way to a stronger and more
unconquerable power-that of Nature. It is the Frisian area that
mest of the great inundatione of the North Sea have broken in
upon. What Vesuvius has been to Campania, AEtna ιο Sicily, Hecla
to Iceland‚ the Ocean has been to Frisia.

The proper complement to the ethnology of this branch, would
be the physical history of the North Sea ; and this is what cle-
mens, the best investigator of the least known part of the family
—the North Frisians-has sketched.

The Frisians have ever been the people of a retira'nq frmatier,
te, whilst others have encroached on their occupancies, they have
never, within the historical period, been successful invaders and
permanent aggressors elsewhere. Not, at least, by laud. By sea,
the case may have been different; so different, that in our own
island much thatpasses for AngleSaxon in origin may be Frisian ;
a matter ιο which a special notice has been dedicated*

On the west the Ocean5 on the north the Denes and how Ger-
mans ; on the south the Low Germane have been the encroachers.

The fact cf the Frisians having thus suffered from encroach-
ment, rather than gained by aggression, has a practical bearing.

Frisian occupancy may be inferred from certain characteristica,
hereefter tc be illustrated: and these characteristica we find in
localities far beyond the present Frisian area. Now, had the
Frisians been a family of conquerors, the inference would be that
the introduction was recent, and that, upon some earlier occupancy,
Frisiau elementa might have been engrafted. But as the truth is
the reverse of this; as the Frisians have habitually retreated rather
than advanced, the conclusion is different, and as Frisiann ames of
geographicsl localities—for of this sort are the characteristics in
question—may reasonably be assumed to denote Frisian occupancy
anterior ιο that of the present dominant population.
