But there is a stronger objection. It will be seen in the nsxt
note that Ptolemy places them in the mma category with the Lycii.

Neither is there any resson to doubt his evidence On the oon·

egeam extract from Nestor* confirms Ptolemy:-“ When the
Wallachians attached the Sloveniane—the Slovenians went forth,
aud settled on the River Vislje (Vistula), and called themselves
Lekhs (Ljactcce). And some ol these people were called Potes, some
huticzi, some Pomoranians.”

This does something more than confirm Ptolemy. It shows that
the root helle was Slavonic‚ ta, the natiue name by which the
Slavonians ol the Vistula called themselves, rather than the name
by which they were called by their aon-Slavonic neighbours.

That the name of Lett was recognised by other writers than
Nestor, indeed, that it was acommon designation, is shown by the
hypothesis of the later chroniclee, where it becomes the name oi the
epoaymus ol the Poles. Tshekh and Lekh ars the two leaders of

two great natione 3 the first of the Poles, the second of the Bohe·
misna. Of the latter, the present native name is Pesla· of the
former, Lells was the oriyiwol denomination.

Hence the name Μὴ in Nestor's time, at least, was active.

After this, does any reader doubt the identity between the Lygii
of Tacitus and the Polesl or, admitting this, does he believe the
Lyys'l to have been Germani

Amongst ethnologista, Zeuss, for ons, insiste on this latter view.
