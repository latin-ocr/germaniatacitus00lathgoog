⁸ This is rnuch beyond the limita cf the present Thuringia. More

than this, it is beyond tha Τενριοχαῑμαι cf Ptolemy. Nevertheless,
sor reasons given in the Epileycmcnc, 1 think the extension highly
probable.

If so, the country of the Hermunduri was the greater part os
Thuringia, plus the valley of the Naab.

The complement tc this note are Epelepomenc, ξ Ostropotln, and
the next note.

² Norisci.]-'l'he Fichtelgebirge, in its western extension, is tho
water-rhed to the Saule and the N aab-north and south; the Saule
belonging to the system cs the Illhe, the N aab to that of the Danube.
Along with the valley cf the N aab, that of the Regen should be con·
sidered ; the Regen being the stream nearest the mountain-frontier os
Bohemia.

The present names of the geographical localities for the system of
these two rivers, are almost wholly German-olnwst, but not quite. ·

Slavonic forms appear occasionally, increasing slightly ss we approach
Bollhldllermau dialect, to which the German names of geographical

localities (as far as it is not an over-refinement to refer them to one
dialect more than another) are rncstly reserablo, is the High German
of Bavaria

Slaronic names occur even west os the N aab 5 though rarely.

Putting all this together, I infer-

n From the existence cf Slavonic names ot all, an early Slavonic
occupancy.

t. From the pancity os them, an early displacement cf such
occupante.

c. From the forms in p, the Alemannic origin of the last invaders.
Mark the word last.

For accompliahing the change from Siavonic to German, the date
of the chief Alemannic conquesta is tull early enough.

But it by no meana follows that, muse Germane of the Alemannic
type conquered a country, originally Slavonic, in the third, fourth, or
finh centuries, they must have been the first Germane who did so.
Earlier encroachers upon the Slavoniane of the N aab and Regen may
have proceeded from the parts to thc north-from Thuringia A
Hermunduric conquest in the first, is perfectly compatible withan

Alemannic in the fifth century.
