also helieving that, next to the Garris, the Germana them-
selves supplied the Romans with information concerning
Germany,l consider it more likely that one -of the two
should he German and native, than that either the Germane
or the Gauls should have used two synonymons designatione.

4. When the name of the nation is the sameas that of
some national hera—Thus, the fact that the Greeks recog-
nized Hellen as the patriarch of their stoch would, even if it
stood alone, he good reason for considering the name Hellenos
to be indigenous. .

5. When the name contains a sound found in the language

Writers, from whom it is unsafe to differ—ae far as they
go on any principles at all, and exercise any doubt whatever
upon the subject-will possibly add another characteristic of
indigenous use. They may consider that the general and
undoubted vernacular use of a given name at one period may

originally. The natural reluctance of a whole nation to take

and importance of the two natione involved. The modern
name Bobium is, undoubtedly, anything hut native, aa, iu

form, and all that can be said in favour of its Belgic character
