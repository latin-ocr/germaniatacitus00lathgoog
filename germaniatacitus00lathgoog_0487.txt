Teutones—Iu the way of evidence of there being Teutones
amougst the Germane, over and above the associate mention
of their names with that of the Oimbri, there is but little.
They are not so mentioned either by Tacitus or Strabo.
Ptolemy‚ however, mentions a) the Teutonarii, l) the Teutones:
Τευτονοάριοι καὶ Οὐίρουνοι-Φαραδεινῶν δὲ καὶ Συήέων,
Τεύτονες καὶ Ἄμαρποι. Resides this, however, arguments
have been taken from a) the meaning of the rout Μαι-φθορὰ
(blada, Meso-Gothicz peo'd, AngloSaxon; dict, Old High
German: l) the soltus Teclobcrgioa: c) the supposed con-
nection of the present word Dect-acl=German with the
classical word Toni-coca. These may briefly be disposed of.

a.) Itis not unlikely for au invadiug nntion to cell thern-
selves lle oetion, tle notione, llo pcepta, dre. Neither‚ if the
tribe in question had done so (presuming them to have been
Germans or Goths), would the word employed be very unlike
Tanton-cs. Although the word pind-c=not·loo or periplo, is
generally strong in its deolension (so making the plural piud-
ὅθ), it is found also in a weak form with its plural thiel-rin:
Tauron. See Deutsche Grammatik, i. 630.

ὁ.) The sollus Tectolcrgioa mentioned by Tacitus (Anu. i.
60) can scarcely have taken its name from a tribe, or, on the
other haud, have given it to one. lt means either tle bill of
tle peopla or tlte city of tle μορίω according as the syllable
derp- ie derived from botrys: a bill, or from banrps=c city.
Iu either case the compouud is allowable‚ ag. diot-wo'a pulli
