xxvi ’ ann ussurus or eronus,

erroneous, or has subsequent change taken placet No general
answer can be given to the question. It depends upon the
credibility of the author on the one side, and the likelihood
of the changes assumed, on the other. If the changes are pro-
bable and the author unexceptionable, the decision is in favour
of the change. If the author, however, be exceptionable aud

the changes such as have never been previously known, the
converse is the case. Between these extremes there is every

, intermediate degree. The changes may be of average magni-

tude, and the author of medium credibility. All this, how-
ever, merely shows that the balance between the conflicting
difficulties is easily struck in some cases, that in some it is
difficult, and in others almost impossible.

Iam not, just at present, prepared to decide upon the
particular case in hand, or to determine whether Tacitus has
been, at one and the same time, accurate in all his state·
ments, and rightly interpreted by his commentators, or
whether he has not coniounded Slavonians and Lithuanians
with Germane. This will come in due time; at present it
is sufficient to take an exception against the uncritical spirit
in which his evidence has been treated. Two distinctions of
paramount importance have been neglected.

1. The estant to which his statements areat varianae with
the first horca state os things subseqnent to his time, has
been overlooked. ’

2. The valna of his evidence for the parts which could
only be known, to even his best informante, by hearsay only,
has been placed on the same level with the value of his
evidence respecting the parts personally known to his con·
temporarias.

How different, for instance, were his means of describiug a
Frisian or a Cheruscan, from his datu for Poland and Silesia.
Yet Poland aad Silesia are parts of the (lemmata of Tacitus,
and Friesland and Osnaburg are no more. The legionary of
Drusus or Tiberius might describe, from personal knowledge,
the populations of Ems, or Weser; but, whoever described the
tribes of the Oder or Vistula, would describe them from hear·
say accounts,—hea1say accounts, which l have no wish to
undervalue,-hearsay accounts which can osten be satisfac·
