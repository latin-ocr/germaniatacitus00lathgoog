J ornandas, also, states that, “ Doni, ex ipsorum (oia, S'cand·
ziae cultorum) stirpe progressi, Herulos propriis sedibus expu-
lerunt,''-reversiug the order of the expulsion.

Be this, however, as it may, wo have the evidence ol two
writers as to the geographical and political contact between
the Dones and Heruli, aud this, il taken without criticism, is a
reason in favour of a long Heraclion migration from north to
south.

But it is not conclusive. If the Dani were called Daci,
the Daci may be called Dani, and, as it is much more certain
that the Heruli came in contact with the Dacians of the
Danube, than with the Danes of the Baltic, a reasonable ob·
jection lies against the evidence of Procopius and J oruandes.
l do not say that it is conclusive. I only show that, whenever
we have a lengthy migratiou, we have the elements ol a
reasonable doubt to set against it. Ι

Eveu if we lay but little stress on this, we have the fact
that neither Jornaudes nor Procopius are satisfactory wit·
uesses to events so distant in both place aud time.

They, probably, speculated and inferred: seeiug that ou
the Danube there were two populations with names so like as
Daoi and Geta, and ou the Baltic two others with names so
like as Doau' and Gothi, Gentes or Gauius.

But how came the similar names to run in pairs? Dones
alone on the Baltic, and Daci alone on the Danube, would be
nothing very remarkable. Nor yet would Gala on the Danube,
and Gratus ou the Baltic. But Geta side by side with Daci
in the south, and Doni (called also Daci) side by side with
Gcatus in the north, supply a mystery. ’

This is a repetition of the difficulties of ἓξ on the Aapl'
and Woriui of Thuringia, aud it is a difficulty of the gravest
character that meets us too often elsewhere.

Aecident is out of the question ς and Ι admit that a ποίμνα-
tion, within a certain degree of probability, is the best solution
of similar problema. But it must be probable; and it must
stand on the phenomeua which it will explain almost exclu-
sively. Such a migration receives but little confirmation from
any so-called traditione, because the very ease with which it
explains the phenomeua, eugenders the disposition to assunre
