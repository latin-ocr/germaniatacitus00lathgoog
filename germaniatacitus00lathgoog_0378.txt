The chief sent of the oum-Goth conquesta wan Italy.
Some uf them settled in portiana of Asin Minor,

a. Jornaudas names a king Oulro-Gollim

b. With the exception! of the Visigoth conquesta 111 Gaul
111111 Spain, the locatitias of the outo-Gotho are fully as wut-
wnrd ns those of the oo-ealled Wulsm Goths.

c. 'Phe oombination -utr iu the river Inter, is identical with
tho combinatiou -str in Outr=9a5h

All this throws a shnde over the usual interpretation of
the prolix Ostron At the same time, nothing very serious
dependo on the etymology.

The most important question connected with the Ouiro-
Guths 111111 Visi-Goths. is 111111 of their original name<

ll* they were 11ι11 called Gom till they reached the 111111] of
tho Gsstae, under what nume did thoy leave Germany!

Under that os orat-unqu and Thero-inqu: these two desig-

· uatium being those which, to say 11111 least, have 11111 best
claim to be considered tho native names οἷ the great Gothic
conquerors ot* tho fourth, fisth, and oixth centurion.

111 Mamertinus ancl Eutropius, we find the forms Teminyn' ,⁴
Ammianus's form is Theroingyn'. Trebellius Pollio (in Clau-
dio) has the namo Virts'nqim which has, reasonahly, boen
considered to bo a transposition of TrevinqL or Tmiuqi.
The similarity of the name Thuriny- leaves ns little doubt iu
the mind of 11111 present writer, as to tho Tha-vingt of Dacia
having been originally the Tkurioyiam of Thur-inpia. as there
111 about the Anyhe of Englaad having once been the Auyloe
os northern Germany.

The evidence 111 favour of the Grutmaya is less satisfactory.

a. The termination only is kmwa to be German ς the
mot is only mppmd to be so.

h. Mure thau one writer eolla them Σκυθαί.

ε, The following passage distinguishes them from the
oure-Goth:—

ourogottic eulina mixtisque [ἒν-1111111511
thyx ηομ-σηπίη.

But 1111 even the undoubted Gotho are called Snythiam by
Zoziinus, 11111 second objection, the strongost of the three, is
but nlight.
