These oonntries have never been known to be more German
than at present, and at present they are Slavonic. At the
sometime, I believe that there are traditione among the pre·
sent Tshekhs, which refer to their conquest of the country and
the usurpation of their ancestors. The valne of these depende
upon their nationality. This may be absolute. It may, on
the other hand, be of the same velue as the traditione about
Brut being the patriarch of the Britons, or, in other words,
the legend may be more due to the influence of a medieval
Latin literature, than the trnly native traditione.

Having thus enumerated the countries which were as much
(or more) Slavonic a thousand years ago as they arc now, Ι
subjoin some of the chief extracta that prove their having been
so-all of them being taken from Zeuss, and those only being
selected which the date accompanies, and where there is,
besides this, the special statement that the population in ques·
tion was Slavonic.

The latest notices come first. They arc chiefly from Adam
of Bremen and Helmoldus, and apply to the Slavonians of

the northern frontier.
