The connexion of the American with the Englishman is
clear. Nearly as clear is that between the Englishman and
the German. In either case there has beeu a continuone
extension of the original population3 and that within the
period of clear and anthentic history.

But what if we found Englishmen iu conntries which no
Englishman was known to have invaded? isolated English·
meni Englishmen ont off from the rest of their nation and
languagei In this case we should have a trnly ethnological
fact; since bincy, properly so called, would be silent.

Or what if we found apart from the other Geminos, simi·
larly isolated populations, whose langnage was indeed German,
bnt of an uncertain affinity-connected with the Dutch as
much as the English, the Norse as much as the Frisian.

What if the language were lost, and nothing bnt similarity
of manners, or some vagne tradition connected them with the
assumed parent stoohi

The problem would become still more complicated.

Now such problema really exist. There are Goths beyond
the pale of England‚ America‚ Germnny, and Scandinavia.
They require notice.

l. The Gernrona ostie Vicentino.— Two (perhaps more)
passages mention the reception, on the part of Theodoric the
OstroGoth‚ of certain Alemannis Germano, within the
boundaries of Italy. One is a letter of his own to Oloris :—
“ Motus vestros in fessas reliquias temperate: qnia jure
gratiae merentur evadere, qnos od parentum nostrornm desen-
sionem respicitis confugisse. Estote illis remissi, qni nostris

finibus celantur eotwriti.''-Cassiod. Variar. ii. 41.

The other is from the Panegyricos Ennodins:—“ Quid
qnod a te Alamannia generalitas intro Itaiiae terminos sine
detrimento Romanae possessionis inclusa esti cni evenit ha·
bere regem, postquam meruit perdidisse. Facto est Latiaris
cados imperii semper nostrornm populatione grassata. Oui
