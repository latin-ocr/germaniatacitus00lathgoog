xxviii assensurus or rscrrus

that the circumstance of certain Greek towns of Southern
Italy, calling their slaves Pelasgi, indicates a previous Pelasgic
population. By a not illegitimate extension of this view,
the existence of the system of costes is supposed to betoken a
duality of race,—the conquered and the conquerors. But a
servile class of conquered aborigines, was as much wanting in
the Slavoniau portions of the Genauam, when it was first
known otherwise thau by hearsay‚ as the analogues of the
Welsh or Biscayans. The signs of a primitive population‚
shown as they show themselves in Britain or Spain; shown
as they showsd themselves in Graece or Italy; or shown es
they showed themselves in Hiudostau‚ were equally non·
existent.

Neither were there any traditione No lays celebrated
either the Arthur which defended, or the Ida which ravaged
the soil. The supposed conquerors knew of no indigena
which they replaced. No indigena complained of the
stranger who dispossessed them.

Lastly‚ Socors as is England‚ the oldest geographieal terms
are Kellic‚· some of the original names of the rivers and
mountains remaining anchanged. The converse is the case
in Transalbingiau Germany. The older the name the more
surely is it Slavonic.

So much for the extent of the assumed displacement. It
must have been the greatest and the most absolute of any
recorded in history.

It must also have taken place with unparalleled rapidity.
By supposing that the assumed changes set in immediately
after the time cf Tacitus, and that as soon as that writer had
recorded the fact that Poland, Bohemia, and Gourland were
parts of Gamala the transformation of these previously
Teutonic ereas into Slavonic ones, began, we have a con·
ditiones favourable fora great amount of changes as can
fairly be demanded. Still it may be improved. The last
traces of the older population may be supposed to have died
out only just before the time when the different areas became
known as exclusively Slavonic3 an assumption which allows
the advocate of the German theory to say that, had our in·
formation been a little earlier, we should have found what we
