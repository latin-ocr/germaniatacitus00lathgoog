There is a difficulty here, which is increased by the fact of the
Danube forming but partially the RhaetoGermanic srontier. A
considerable portion of the Rhaetia oi Tacitus reached the Danube
as its northern limit, without, therefore, reaching the southern fron-
tier of Germany. The Decumates Agri lay north of the Danube,
between Vindelicis, Gaul, and Germany. Yet itis by no means
certain, that the Decumates Agri were German—See not. in voc.

Perhaps a more minute investigation than the present writer has
had the opportunity of making, into the early history oi the Danubian
provinces just enumerated, would account for the omission of the
names Vindelicis and Noricum, and at the same time ιο inform us
how the Norican population was to be distributed. At present,
however, I consider that Tacitus, in mentioning the thoeti and
Pannonii· only, recognized the ethnobpiccl rather than the petitioni
division, and thought of the natural division of an area into its
nationalities rather than of the artificial distinction os provinces.

Isso, we have an instrument of criticism 3 since we may infer that
the Vindelici were in the same category with the Rhoeti, and that
the Norici were either Rhoetian or Pannonian, or else divided be-
tween the two.

The ethnological position of theRhaetians, the extem to which
they consisted oi one or several stocks, and their relations to the
population os Noricum, are difficult and complicated questions.
N either are they true portione os German ethnology.

Hence the present note will conmin little beyond the notice of
the country and its occupante in their present state.

Politically speaking, Rhaetia with Vindelicis, comprises the fol-
lowing countries and districta-l. The Vorarlberg. 2. The Gri-
sons,orGraubriindten. 3. TheValteline. 4. TheTessino. 5. The
Tyrol. 6. Part os Lombardy. These form Rhaetia proper. une
southern part of Bavaria, the south-eostam part oi Wurtemburg,
,and a small portion of Baden constitute Vindelicis.

Geographically vieued, this area embraces a portion of two water·
systems, and a water-shed, uia, the southern feeders of the Upper
Danube, and the northern foedere of the Po 5 the water-rhed between
them being formed by the Alps. Besidee these the head-waters of

the Rhine belong to Rhaetia
⁴ Orthe Rnaess‘ and Pannonia.
