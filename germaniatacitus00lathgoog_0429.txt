tia cell him so, aud wool England use the namo thus applied.
But that is all.

In his own eyes he isaMojiar,· Mogariar as the few old
Latin writers who adhere to the native appellatiou have it-
Mogerius, or sometimes Denta-Mogerius.

Yet, with all this, he is not a Hungariau exactly, astho
Spaniard of the N ew Worldis a Mexican; and the reason why
the Slavouiaus call him Hungariau is aot because he settled
in a country to which the name of Hnugary had been pre-
viously given by the Huns of Attila. The proofs of this
name being in use between the fitth and ninth centurias, are
few and far between ς nor yet are they absolutely conclusive.

The real reason why the Majiar bears in countries aronnd
him the same name with the subjects of the Scourge of God
lies deeper. Just as the Germanic nations call not only the
GambroBritons by the name Walal, but the ltalians also,
the Russians of Eastern Europe called their most western
Asiatic neighbours by the general name of Uapri-whether
Turk or Finn: so that whether the one or whether the
other wrested from Europe a part of the soil, the territory
thus appropriated would equally be called Huugary.

This we learn from Nestor, who separates the Ugrian Ma·
jiars from the Turk Chanars, by calling the oue Black the
other While* Huus.

From the name Hau not being native, the investigation
of the ethnological affinities of that nation becomes difficult;
and this difficulty is increased by its being applied to two
different classes of western Asiatica. It unfortunately
happens, too, that whilst the rulers of the Avam, the Obazars,
the Petobinegi and other tribes are frequently mentioned by
the truly 'l'urk term Kboa (Χάιγανος), that title is never
given to Attila—who is either roa or βασιλεύς. On the other
hand, however, Paulus Diaconos writes-“ Huni qui et Aoum
dicuntur ;'' and Priscus speaks of the eleazar-Hom (Ἀκάτιροις
Οὔννοις), the Tartar affinities of the Ohazars being beyond

doubt, and the lring of the Avars being often called Khan
(Xciyavoe).

¹* The forms of this word are, in the Old Slavonic Ugri, in Boheminn
Ulrrp, in Polisb ngri, in Russian Vengri.
