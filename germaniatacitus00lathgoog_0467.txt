languages coming from Europe, Of course, there are reasons
for this one-sidedness‚ and, amougst these, the reasonable
doctrine that the human species originated in Asia, the
aomewhat cnrde notion that migratione move from cast to
west, rather than from west to east, aa if iu obedience to some
ethnological law, and the unwillingness to believe that the
primary migratione by which the population of the earth's
snrface spread from some single point over the four quarters
of the world, lie far beyond any existing means of investiga-
tion, are the chief.

N evertheless, if we clear our minda of all this, the presump-
tiona are the other way.

When two allied populations, covering areas of different
magnitudes, are separated from each other, and we account
for the separation by assuming a migratiou, the presumption
is that the occupante of the smaller area are derived from that
of the larger‚ rather than vioe vasa.

When an ethnologieal class falls into a certain number of
divisione, the portion of its area, where the divisione are the
most numerous and the most definite, must be considered as
the oldest.

Such are the presarnptiona-presumptions which we get at
by attending to the first principles of reasoning—presumptions

. which our common-sense supplies us with. No one, lima·

gine, will deuy their general validity‚ however much ho may
consider that, in certain individual cases, they give us a wrong
result.

Thus, talen ly ilself, the presumption that arises from the
vast extent over which the English language is spoken in
Amerina, as compared with the limited area of the Britislr
lsles, is in favour of the American being the mother-tongue,
which is known to be contrary to fact.

But the mere question of a magnitude of area need not be

talen dy itaalf. It is corrected by the presumption arising
out of the second observation. In Ameriae, the English
language stands either alone or nearly so, In England it has
its omryerrors around it‚-Frisian‚ Dutch, Platt-Deutsch,
High German, and Norsez and this shows that Europe is
the older home of the Englishman.
