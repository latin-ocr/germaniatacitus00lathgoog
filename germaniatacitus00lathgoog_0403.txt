sent against him Julius Nepos, likewise a noble Roman, who,
with some assistance from Constantinople, took possession of
Rome and Ravenna. Glycerins abdicated; but Orestes, a
Roman of Noricium‚ who had risen into importasse as carly

, as the time of Attila, refused obedience to Nepos. After the

withdrowal of Gundohald from Italy, Orestes became patri·
cius, that is commender-in·chief.''—Niebuhr, [tecture 138.

The conntrymen, then, of Gundobald, at least, were Roman-
ized; and that largely.

Ι have said that the undoubted use of the root Suco-,¹⁵ as
applied by certain Germane to themselves, is the only strong
reason against the original non-Germanic character of the
word. As others, however, may be satisfied with the fol-
lowing derivation, it is laid before them 2-Swade, Middle
High German; Saepo, Old High German; θυσίαι, Anglo-
Saxon, are derived from the root oroidon=swoy, move αα-
ιιοαάιίμς and, hence, Saevi (or Serti) is the designation of a
people of unsteady migratory habits—“monton (sotum
άοιι) Ledonewciso.”-Zeues, p. 56.

It cannot be denied that the passage of Strabo confirma
this view :-Kowlw δ’ ἐστὶν ἅπασι τοῖς ταύτῃ τὸ περὶ τὰς
μεταναστάσεις εὐμαρὲς, διὰ τὴν λιτότητα τοῦ βίον καὶ διὰ
τὸμὴ γεωργεῖν, μηδὲ θησαυρίζειν, ἀλλ’ ἐν καλυάίοις οἰκεῖν
ἐφήμερον ἔχουσι παρασκευήν· τροφὴ δ’ ἀπὸ τῶν θρεμμάτων
ἡ πλείστη, καθάπαν τοῖς Νομάσιν· ὥστ’ ἐκείνους μιμούμενοι,

“ τὰ οἰκεῖα ταῖς ἁρμαμάξαις ἐπάραντες, ὅποι ἂν δόξῃ, τρέ·

τονται μετὰ τῶν βοσκημάτων. Still, I think it unsatisfactory.

ΙΙ. flodovei osPtolomy.-Ptolemy's Saevi (see text) are
the Eovvidoc'AvyyeOeoc, to the east of the Lombards, and on
the middle Altis,† and the Σουήβοι Σεμνόνες extending from
the Altis, to the river Scelus.

This division introduces a difficulty which even a migration
will not explain.

The Suevi of Suabia are High Germane.

The Ἀγγείλοι Σουήθοι ean scarcely have been other than
Angle, ι“.ι., Saxon.

Ἰ Srocjhs occurs in the Traveller's Song.
† I write Alta, because the river of the Semnones Ι believe to have been
not the Ehe but the Such. Soc note in vv. Ex Hermunduris Albi, oritur,
