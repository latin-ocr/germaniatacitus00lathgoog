A shade of evidence in favour os the original Nariscs' having been
Slawonic, is to be got l'rom the confusion between the form in -ac-
and that in -st-; the ίάοοιίιμ beiay manuel.

Α Solcooaic affinity would best account for this; since, aucha
form might end in aas (Noritsh),a syllable which contains both
tho t out os which -οι, and the sd out of which oc· might be dese·
loped Nayl such an ending as ewen aaa would be nothing
unusual in Slavonic. lio German form existe which gives us an
equally probable origin os the two forms. ln that language it would
bc either -tsk ιο the exclusion os the sound os t, or ist to the exclusion
of that of k,· neither of which would bs sufficiently strange ιο a
Roman or Greek ear ιο bs mistaken for the other, or, indeed, for
anything else. Very different, however, would be the case with the
complex Slavonic sibilante. ι

A sound like the oh in cheat (tals), was a strange sound to the

another by -οι

As τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ may apply to any portion of Roman Gaul, this
passage may give us the origin of the Waroscs'.

hgain-as a mere guess, I suggest the probability oi their repre·
senting some os those intrusive members of the kingdom of Ariovistus
who appropriated a third os the land of the Sequani, as related by
