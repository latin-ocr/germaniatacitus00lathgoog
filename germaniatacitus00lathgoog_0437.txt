cx THE GERMANY OF vnclvus.

simply Liguricum and, as such, probably Keltic. This,
however, is 00 part of German ethnology.

What follows 10 0 mere suggestion. It has arisen from
the extent to which the pluri-presence of populations with
names in ·mhr- would be explained hythe hypothesis that
that combination was, like the word Marcomanni, expressive
of some physical or political relation: in which case there
might be as many nations named Amhr-ones, Umbri, Cenchr-i,
Gambrivii, Sicambri, dac, as there were instances of such a
relationship occurring. In this case, of course, all the names
must be referable to one language. This is no difficulty.
Such a language is the Kcltt'c.

Now all the natione thus named occupy the lower part of
some river, aa, its Hamlcr.

1. The Ambrones seem to have been on the Lower Rhene.

2. The Umbri on the Lower Po.

3. Τ10 Oumbriaus of Oumberland on the Solway.

4. Tlrc Gambrivii aud 1810000101*οο the Lower Rhine.

Assume, then, Hamhcr to be the Gallio and Ena-Britan
form of the Welsh Ahar, and the GaelicnIaocr=moath of a
macr, aud all these facts are connected.

Still, the doctrine is but a suggestion, and its application
to the details of the cambit and Kymry has yet to be
made. .

One fact, however, deserves notice. Both the cimbri and
Ambrones are said to have been driven from their own
country by inundatione.

Of the Ambrones Festus (1000 011010) writes-“ Ambrones
fuerunt quaedam gens Gallica qui, subita inundatione maris,
cum amisissent sedes suas rapinis at praedatiouibus se suosque
alere ceperunt.”
