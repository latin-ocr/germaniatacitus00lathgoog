Procopius makes them Goths; but his language may apply
to their politica} relations, besides which, he connects them
with the Vooduls, and says that they were originally called
Sauromata and Meduacblaeai-Fordsxd έθνη πολλὰ μὲν καὶ
ἄλλα πρότερόν τε ἦν καὶ τανῦν·ε’στι, τά δὲ δὴ πάντων
μέγιστά τε καὶ άξιολοηάτατα Γάτθοι τέ εἶσι καὶ Βανδίλοι

καὶ Οὐῑσίηιοτθοι καὶ Γήταιδες. Πάλαι μέντοι Σαυρομάται
καὶ Μελάγχλαινοι ὠνομάζοντο· εἰσὶ δὲ ol καὶ Γετικδ ἔθνη
τοῦτ’ ἐκάλουν. Οὗτοι άταντες ὀνόμασι μὲν ἀλλήλων δια-
φέρουσιν, ὥσπερ εἴρηται, άλλιρ δέ τῶν πάντων οὐδενὶ
διαλλάσσουσι. Λευκοὶ ιγάρ ἅπαντες τά σώματά τέ εἰσι καὶ
τὰς κόμας ξανθοὶ, εὐμήκεις τε καὶ άηαθοὶ τάς ὄψεις, καὶ
νόμοις μὲν τοῖς αὐτοῖς χρῶνται, ὁμοίως δὲ τὰ ἐς τὸν θεὸν
αὐτοῖς ἤσκηται. Τῆς γὰρ Ἀρείου δόξης εἰσιν ἅπαντες, φωνή
τε αὐτοῖς ἐστι μία, Γοτθικὴ λεγομένη, καί μοι δοκοῦν ἐξ ἑνὸς
μὲν εἶναι ἅπαντες τὸ παλαιὸν ἔθνους, ὀνόμασι δέ ὕστερον
τῶν ἑκάστοις ἡγησαμένων διακεκρίσθαι-ΒεΗ. Vandal. i. 2.

Πολλῷ δὲ ἄποθεν (τῆς Μαιώτιδος) Γάτθοι τε καὶ Οὐῐσθγοτθοι

καὶ Βανδίλοι καὶτὰ ἄλλα Γοτθικά ηένη ξύμπαντα ἵδρυντο.
-Bell Goth. iv. 5. .

He adds, too, Σκίῤῥους τε καὶ Ἀλανο ὺς καὶ ἄλλα Γὸτθικα .
sem-Bell. Goth. i. 1. Now the Alans were, assuredly,
no Goths in ethnology. See § Αἰακὲ.

The evidence, then, in favour of their being Goths or
Germans, is that of so many others. Their allianees, and the
names of some of their leaders, along with a (socalled) tra-
dition are in their favour; their locality against them. So
is the gloss Gepaatu. So is the express evidence of Procopius.

§xxun run enarrans.

These are first mentioned by Mamertinus, nn. 291 ε their
locality being on the Middle Danube, and their chief politica}
relations with the lberoinys, Vondols, Gepida, Ostra-Gotls,
andemiyaatos.

Zosimus, an indifferent authority, makes them Scythiaus:
-Ἐπελθόντων δὲ Θαῑφάλων, Σκυθικοῦ γένους, ἱππεῦσι
πεντακοσίοις, οὐ μόνον οὐκ ἀντετάξατο τούτοις, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸ

πολὺτῆς δυνάμεως άττοθαλὼν, καὶ τὰ μέχρι τοῦ χάρακος
