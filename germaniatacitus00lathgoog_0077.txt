That (leesor was the chief first-hand authority for the

⁸ main details concerning early Germzmy, is evident3 at thc

same time it is not in Gaesar that the classification into
ln'gaevones, Istaevones, δια, is to be found. Neither is itin
Geesar that the parts which were not visited until after his
timeare described. The broad distinction between Gaul and
German ia his; the Gaul being taken astho type.

The extent to which the names in Cacsar differ from
those of Tacitus creates certain slight difficulties. His uo-
mention of the Cotti is a most remarkable instance of this.
Thac Gaesar's names are chiefly Gallio, whilst·Tacitus's are
' Germanic, is, in the mind of the present writer, the chief
explanation here.

'she greatest difficulty lies in the second and third ex-
tracta, wherein certain Belgica populations are made Ger-
man. Ι can only reconcile this with the great preponderance
of evidence in favour of the Belgae being Gauls, by consider-
ing the term Belgio in the book of Gaesar to be political
rather than ethnological; in other words, to denote a cou-
sceleratiore rather than a homogeneous nation. At the same
time we may admit both intermixtum* and intmsion.

Theso preliminaries precede the following extracts3 the

criticism of which will lind its place indifferent parts of tho
body of the boolr.
