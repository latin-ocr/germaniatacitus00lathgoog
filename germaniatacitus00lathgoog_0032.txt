2. The Oroatians-themselves the speakers of a langnage
which extends, with but few variatione of dialect, from the
Adriatic to the Euxine-the langnage of the Montenegrino
mountaineers on the frontier of Albania, the Dalmatiam, the
Hemegovinians, the Bosniacs, the Serviane, the southern
Hungarians, the Slavonians of Slavonia at the junction of the
Save and Danube, aad the Bulgarians.

The Slavonie languages, like the Germanic, must be studied
in respect to their history as well as their geographical
distribution-in respect to lineo as well as place. ln this
respect, the fact which has the most important application is
connected with the southern division of them. lt was in a
Servium Oroatian, orDalmatian, dialect that Christianity was ι ,;’,.,.’..υ
first preached, and the first scriptural translations made.
Hence, the socelled old Slavonic has thesaure importance iu
Rnssian aud Servian philology as the MoesoGothie has in
German.

The northern frontier of the south-Slavouie area is formed
by a line running through Styria, Seuthem Hungary, and the
northern part of Bulgaria; the southern frontier of the
northern hy Bohemia, Moravia, Gallicia, Volhynia, and Pedo
lia3 the intermediate ameSlavonic countries being Hungary,
Wallachia, and Moldavia.

The Hungarians, or Majiars, are of Finnic origin, and
constitute an intensive population, the date of their intrusion
being the tenth century.

The Wallachians, Moldavians, and Bessarabians are par·
tially at least of Latin origin, aad, so far as they are so,
they constitute, like the Majiars, an intrusive population,
the date of their intrusion being the second century, ia, the
time of Trajan the conqueror of Dacia.

We have seen that, in respect to their geographical dis·
tribution, the Russians, Poles, and Bohemians, belong to
one division, the Serviane and Slavonians to another. Is
