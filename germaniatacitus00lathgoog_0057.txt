their way of denoting it was less precise than our own, and
not always expressed in the same terms.

Of the Ugriaus they knew little. Nevertheless, Tacitus
and others distinguish between the Finns and the Germane.

The Albaniana, l think, were distinguished from the Greeks
clearlyr but from the natione on their northern frontier in·

distinctly. The term Illyrica comprises the Albomiacs, aad '

samotinga moro.

The Iberians were clearly distinguished from all other
stocks but tbe Keltic—from that indistinctly.

Upon the whole, the ancients may ba said to have ouer·
valued the difference between themselves and the other six
stocks, and to have medervalued the difference between tbe
other groups of Europe; and this is just what tbe Spaniards
and English did and do with the present American abori-
gmes.

These observatione bava been made upon tbe assumption
that the only point which required illustratiou was tbc extent
to which the ancients aud moderna differed in their views of
the same plocensem an assumption which supposes tbat tho
number of stocks at the beginning of the historical period was
neither more nor less than it isat present, and that their
mutual relations were the same. This, however, may not
have been the case. Stocks may have become extinct3 or,
instead of the broad and trenchaut lines of demarcation which
now separate the great groups from each other, there may
have been a series of imperceptible transitione. In either of
these cases it would be incorrect to say that the modern view
is more scientifio than the ancient. The latter, instead of

seeing the same things in a different light, may bave seen a
different state of things.
