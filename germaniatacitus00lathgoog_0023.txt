In the three kingdoms they went ou so as for two,* or more, ,
new laugnages to have been evolved. In Iceland, however, the

The descent of the present Frisian is from tha Old
Frisian3 a langnage of which we have specimens as early
as the thirteeuth century.

The desccut of the present English is from thc Anglo-
Saxam a langnugc of which we havc specimens as old as
the eighth century.

The descent of the present Dutch of Hollaud is from the
Old Dutch; a language of which the oldest specimen is no
older thau the thirtecnth century.

The descent of the present High German is from the old
dialccts of Hesse, Baden‚ Wurtemburg‚ and Bavaria; the
oldest specimens of which are ss old as the eighth century.

With these prelimiuarics‚ we find that out of the existing
languages the majority can be traced upwards to a certain

Frisiau as far as the Dutch, and thc English further

than the Frisiau; a fact which leads us to speak of the
Old Frisiau as opposed to the Midea Frisiau‚ and the
MiddleFrisian as opposed to the Nea· and so on through·
out. But as this distinction is of subordinate importance in
ethnology, it¹ will nothe further illustrated.
