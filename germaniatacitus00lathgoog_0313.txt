¹ Aliud mytra puram-The Arctio Ocean.

² Rodios capitia.]-The Aurora Borealis( ).

³ Sauciet marir.]-The Norse form was probably something like
Sci-bcfi* just as Nord-bco, at the present moment=the N ortt-aec .·
bos being the Scandinavian word for both sec and ccccm in which
case the -c in Suco, is, really, the -o- in boc.

At any rate, it seems saie to consider the formation of the word
aa applied to the Swediab Sec, as differant from that cs the Suco, in
Saevi and smn- thcugh no such difference is recognized by
Tacitus.

Indeed, we must attribute some nnsteadiness of expression to him
here.

α. The ritca aad customa of tlte AEstii cra Seoeoe'c. - This may,
possibly, apply to the Sneri of Suabia, and Franconia.

b. Hic (beyond Tinland) Sueoioefiuis. This can scarcely do sc.

⁴ AEstiorcm pentsa]-The word pentes prepares us to expect in
AEstii-as in Suevi-a collective name. Such is, really, the case.

That the AEatii of Tacitus were tho occupante of the present coast
of Prussia and Conrland, is shown by what is said about the anates·-
trcde. This fixes the locality as definitely as AEtna would fix Sicily,
or Vesuvius Campania

Like Sationes, AEatii is a word from a Gothic informant.

The form in which it reached Tacitus was probably Baete-ie„
the strong form cf the grammarians.

But the wealr form was also used since, in a quotation which will
soon appear, we find the form ὨστίωνεςεΕαειαπ.

Aa this is one oi the three non-compound words,† for which I not
only assum an etymology, but argue from it,I shall consider the
form os the word somewhat at length.

It, apparently, is not an nnexceptionable form. Being a geogra-
phical rather than a gentile name, we should expect to find it oom-

* With the article Sci-hcu-et, like Norddcoet.
† See Prolegcmenc, p. liii.
