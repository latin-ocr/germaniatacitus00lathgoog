uueqnivocally Sarmatian, without trace or veetige of any pre-
vious Germanic population-no German names for the rivers
or mountaius, and no Germanic strongholds iu any of the
impervions foreste and impracticable fens—no traditione on
the part of the Sarmatiam of their own comparatively recent
arrival in the country. That any portion of the present Ger·
mauic population of the countries in question is descended from
an ancestry earlier than sn. 800, is what uo one hae ever
ventured to essert, so evidently ie it of recent origin, and so
totally hae any older population-if such ever existed—died
off without leaving truce, or shadow of a trace, of ite
existence.

Pomeracio, Ecet os tle Odor. — Adam of Bremen first
mentions these Pomeranians, and he mentions them as Slavo-
nians, the Oder being their bonndary to the west. On the
east they were conterminous with the Prussiaus. Their name
is Slavonic, po=oc and more=em,=cocetmen. All their
antiquities and traditione are equally so; in other words there
is neither evidence, nor shadow of evidence, of their ever
having dispossessed an older Germanic population. Nor are
they wholly extinct at the present moment. On the promon-
tories which project into the Gulf of Dantzig we find the
Slavonic Kamai, Ooaechitae, or Koezeb. Their lauguage
approaches the Polish.

Pomeronio, west os the Odor, aad the coetera part of Meek-
habero-No definite notices of these parte occur before the
time of Gharlemagne. From that time downwards, however,
they are numerous. Tha only Germane that they recognize are
the conqueriug invaders. On the other hand, the Slavonic
populations are carefully enumerated, aud so thoroughly do
they fill up the whole area that there is neither uook nor
crauny for any thing German. The chief nation is that of
the wilzi, Welatabi, or Limici, falling into the minor divi-
sions of the Olizzici, near the present town of Rostock, the
Circipaui, on the coast opposite the Isle of Rugeu, the To- ·
lensi, on the Tollensee, and the Ratirarii of the ciuitas Rethro.
Now, whatever the others may have been, these last were no
new-comere, since the town was proeminent for its antiquity,

and the temple which it contained celebrated forits sanctity.
