Cesar’s evidence goes the same way. His Boionio joined lieri·
cum, which our Bohernia does not—“Boiosque‚ qui trans Rhenum
incoluerunt, et in agrum Noricum transierunt, Noreiamque oppu-
gnarent, receptos ad se socios sibi adsciscunt”-Bell Gall. i 6.

So does that of the following inscription :—n voucsr1o e v. m.
rmuo. rann. oon. 1. romeon ru usur. rnnr. nnn nsuvvr. nr
o1v1rsron norrun noronurr nr scaurorum-Gruter, 490, 2.

We moy now traco the neme Bovario. In the geographer of
Ravenna is the following corrupt passage :-“ list patrieque di·
citur Albis ungani (l) montuosa per longum, quae ad orientem
multum extenditur, cujus aliqua pers Boios dicitur.”

It is in the same geographer that the neme Baiouarii first occure

Zeuss’s reasoning is that Bcice=Bobemic; that the Boio-ocris'
came from thence, and that changing their places they changed the
form oi their name also. “ The Baiouarii, Paiqira, Bcs'em are from
the country Boia. This population changed its loculity with its
name”=Die Baiovarii, Paigira, Baiern sind die aus dem lu'nde Boin.
Mit seinenr namen indert des Volk auch 'scine Sitze”-pp. 367,
368.

N o one need admit more ireely than Zeuss, thet ull evidence of
this migrationes the Boiam from Bohemia is wanting3 as well

as thet there is no evidence of Bobemic having ever been called
Bovario.

I collect, too, from his numerous and valnablc quotations, that-

1. The evidence of the present country of Baocra‘c being culled
by a compound of Boio÷rocro, begins as early as the sixth century.

2. Thet the evidence of the present country οἰ Bobemio being
called by a compound of Boio÷teim is no earlier then the eleventb.

l also collect from the seme data, that, though the Baverinns of
Bevaria are called Boii as late aa the eleventh century, there is no
instance of the Botom'oru being so called-save end except in the
equivocal case of the Boio oi the geographer oi Ravenna. ,

This reduces the evidence of the old Boio-hemum being Bobenia
to two iacte-

1. 'Phe name Boia ; supposed to mean Bobenia, from the fact of
its being on the veter-system of the Elbo. nuorenbere may
mean the Saule. See not in v. Hermunduri.

2. 'l'he present name Borma
