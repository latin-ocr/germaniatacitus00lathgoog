Perhaps the river Mores. It is not necessary, however, that it
should have any ascertained meaning.

Ι take the words “ Marsigni ammons mosque Ssoeooa refer-affl as
they stand.

It is against the principles laid down in a previous part of the
work to lightly admit as Germanic any nation placed, like the
Marsigni (terga Marcomanorum-cloacina) beyond the March.

But it is also against other principles to trsat a definite assertion
of an author like 'l'acitus summarily.

We must, also, take the word Sirenses as he understood it, ie, as
meaning dimaon-not as his present commentator does, ie, as
meaning Statonia

Hence, there are no preco objections against the Marsigni being
considered German-or, rather, as they are a frontier population,
and, consequently, involving no serious error either one way or the
other, there is no need for an over-scrutinizing criticism.

The same applied to the Quadi and N arisci.

wodenii-The -ο- here is almost certainly of the same inflexional
or non-radical character with the -ce- in Goth-ones,· and the same
criticism‚ in other respecta, applies to it—See note in v. (dottam

In Ptolemy we find that beyond the Basvoxotpas (Bavarians)
were the Batiai-‘Ystp οὓς (Βοινοχοῖμους) Βατεινοὶ, sai ἔτι ὑπὲρ
τούτους, ὕπὸ τὸ Ἀσκιξοιιργιον ὅρος Κορκοντοὶ, καὶ Λοῦγιοι οἱ Βοῦρα,-
μὲχρι τῆς κεφαλῆς τοῦ Οἰιιστοιῖλα ποταμοῦ. Ὑπὸ δὲ τούτους, πρῶτοι
Σίδωνες, εἶτα Κόγνοι, εἶτα Οὒῖσξοιίργιοι, ὑπὲρ τὸν 'Optimos δρυμόν.
Now Zeuss considers that Κόγνοι isa fault in the MSS. for llis-vos,
which is likely enough. He also thinks that the Κότνοι are the
Κότινοι os Dion Cassius, and that the Κότινοι of Dion (lessius arethe
Gothini of Tacitus-which is likely too.

The iren-mines, combined with the statement as to their language,
fix the Gothini in the Gallician Carpathians.

Gallico-lingue.-I know no reasons for believing that the
name Holt'tsch, the Slavonic form for Gallicae is one whit less ancient
than the names Gula, Britannia, Italia, Hellas, dac.

Until I do, 1 translate Gallica by Getam ,· considering that the
same similarity, with the same likelihood of creating error, between
words as like as the form out cf which Gallicis grew, and that out
of which the Romans formed Galli and the Greeks Γαλάται, ex·
isted in the time of Tacitus as now.
