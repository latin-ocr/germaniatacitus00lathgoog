Nrnnnnn has expressed an opinion, that the Germnin was
written during the youth of Tacitus.

Whatever other reasons there may besor holding this view,
there is the following,—

A writer in amonogrnph is generally fuller of details thnn
heis ina general work. Now in the Annals and History,
there are several German tribes mentioned, of which no notice
is taken in the domnonia, and this omission is explained by
tha notion, that Tacitus's knowledge incressed between tho
composition of the different works. Strangc as it is, that
he should not have known the Sicambri, Ampsivarii, hc,
when the Germania was written, it is stranger still, that ho

· should have known and not enumerated them.

Hence, the Annals and History are, to a certain extent,
the complement to the Germania, and similarly to compare
small things with great, the present Epikyomena form tha
complement to the Notos.

Of the populations mentioned in the Annals and History,
bnt not mentioned in tho Germania, the following is the list.

1. The Sicambri-Fun mentioned by Cesar on the Lower
Rhine (see extranta p. laria), the Sicambri take considerable
prominence and importance in the reign of Augustus. Being
conquercd by Drusus, they appear more than once in the
poetry ol both Ovid and Horace, as formidable enemies now
humbled. Indeed, few names were more associated with the

ideas of murdcrons ferocity and savagc bravery than that of
the sicando.
