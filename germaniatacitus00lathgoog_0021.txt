Branches of the same great class occur in all the quar·
ters of the world; in the Asiatic possessions of Great Bri·
tain and Holland; in America3 and at the Cape of Good
Hope, in Africa; the Dutch and the English being the
chief natione by whom the family has been extended in
these parts.

The migratione which have carried the Germanic popula·
tione thus far, have taken place within the last four centuries,
and belong to that stage in the history of mankind which
followed the great geographical discoveries of the sixtecnth
century, the revival of ancient learning, and the evolution of
modern science. The earlier migratione represent a wholly
different social state.

The present classification of the tribes and families in
question is as follows.

1. The Norwcgians of Norway, the Swedes of Sweden,
the Danes of J utland aud tha Danish islands, together with
the Icelanders of Iceland and the inhabitants of the Faroe
Islands, constitute the first division; a division which may
⁸ conveniently be called the scandinaviam, or Norae.

2. The Frisioos of Friesland, Heligoland‚ and Sleswick
constitute the aooood.

3. The Eopliolo of Grsat Britain, Ireland, and America, the
third.

4. The Dutch of Hollond, and the Flemioys of Flanders,
a fourth.

5. The Loto-Germane (or Phili-Deoiaol) of Sleswick,
Holstein‚ parts of Hanover, Mechlenbnrg‚ and the Lower
Rhine, the fifllt.

6. The HighGermans of Haase, Franconia, Swabia, Ba· '
varia, Austris aud Switzerland, the aioth.

I am far, however, from considering the divisione as abso·
lutely scientific. Their value is not uniform3 ay, the
Dutch and Flemings may fairly be placed in the sama class
with the Platt·Deutsch or Low Germans3 and such would
have been done if their greater political importancc had
not given them a prominence on other grounds.

All, then, that the previous divisione cando, isto serve as
a groundwork for further investigation.
