Such iu the cnse where the two presumptione differ—one
complicating the other. Yet even then the case is clear.

When they coineide, it is clenrer still. Thus, when we
bave a oompnmtively homogeneous lnnguage eunfined to the
amanet of two ureae on une eide, and on the other a multipli-
city of divisione and subdivisione spread over the lui-ger, the
preeumption that the occupante of the former are derived frum
those of the latter, ie indefinitely raised.

To n'pply these rulee to the present cuse—

Northern India, Pereia, Armenia, and u small portion of
Caucasus, form the maa-imum of aren that ean be given to the
so-cnlled Iudo-European Iauguuges os Asia.

Euglaud, Germauy. Holiand, two thirds of Seandiunvin,
Κακὴ», Polnnd, and all southern Europe, with the exception
of Rumeliu, Albania, and nimy, surm the minimum of areu
sor tha so—oalled Indo-Eumpean Iunguuges of Europe.

Now the batt that is allowed tu the tongues of Europe is
more tis-n the mon that can be given ιο those of Aria. The
excesu mny be but smalh still, pro tauto, it shows which way
the presumptioni in.

Again—the ynam! amount uf division that cau be got out
of the Asiatic clm of Indo-Europam tongues ie the Ossetic,
Armenian, und Indo-Persian teng-uem the latter meaning the
Sanskrit md the ancient langunge· alliecl to it, with their
real or supposed derivativa—the modern tongues of Persiu
and northern India.

The han amount of divi-ion amongst the Eumpean tongues
is equa! ιο this3 for 1 submit that the differenees between the
Latin (with its derivativee) md the Greek, the Slnvonifl, the
Lithuunie, und the eevernl bmuches of the Gothia etoek, ure
fully equal in velue and variety tu those that any principle of
chseificatiou cau get fmm the tongues of Indu-Europen Asin.

But mure must be added. Rightly or'wrongly, there iu un
opinion thet the modern languages of northern Indin ure not
ludo-Europen ; und—-

ssightly ur wrougly, there is uu opinion that the Armenian
is not ludo-Europen:—

Yet uo one, who ndmits the term at all, hae ever taken
exceptione to my of the Indo-Europen tongues os Europe,
