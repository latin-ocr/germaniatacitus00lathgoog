That there was, at least, one body of Gauls on the German side
of the Rhine, is a fact ιο which we have Caesar as awitness. His
langusge respecting the Volece Tectosages, is that of s men speaking
ιο what he knows at firsthand.

For the locality of such Translthenane Gauls, in the tirne of
(loesar, no district has a better claim than Baden and Wurtem·
burg—the apri Decumates of Tacitus. We come to this con·
clusion by the exclusive method. It was not vaitzerland, for
that was Helvetian; nor yet the Middle Rhine, since, in those
parts, there seems ιο heve been Germane of the Alemannis
division.

The impert of the name Vetere Tectosages is by no means clesr.
Of the two words composing it, the former (v'olcae) was generic, the
latter (Tectoscpcs) specific; since, besides the division in question,
there was a second-the Volcoe Arecomici.

The area of the Volcae of Gaul in general seems ιο have been the
parts between the Bhonc and the ,Pyrenees3 but as the name was
probably collective rather than special, the history of the Volece of
Gaul is obscure. Caesar mentions them only incidentally.

How the Gauls beyond the Rhine came thither is another ques·
tion. They may have done so by simple intrusion, ie, just ss
Caesar was told they did. This intrusion may have been either
early or late-as late es the times approaching those of (laesar
himself, or earlier than the well-known migration-real or sup·
posed-deseribed by Livy, and referred to the reign of Tarquinius
Priscus-Lib. v. 34, 35.
