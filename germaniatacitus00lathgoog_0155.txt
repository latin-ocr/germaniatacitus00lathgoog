Pennino Alps anterior to the Keltic migrations towards Italy, sug-
gests the following etymologies and parallels.

a. Tylonqii-—The same as the Tulingi ol Cesar, with tho αΙ
changed into i, hythe Greek authority os Avienus, so that the
werd becomes Tultu'yyrct, instead of Τνλίγγιοι. The day (·ιγγ) is
the usual German derivational affix, and the nul, the root ol tho
first part of the compound word Τουλίφουρδον (a German town
mentioned by Ptolemy)‚ and til, a root signifying merulfi.

b. Dolitemi—Agreeing in its termination with the words Basternas,
and Gubernt, and in its beginning with the root dol=oolley, dole.

c. Cllabilct'.-The Καοῦλκοι of Strabo, the Kuhohrueec of Ptolemy
and the Caluennae of Pliny.

The objections that lie against all this are-

1. The identity between the tribes named by Avienus and lhose
indicated by Livy isnot made out.

2. The tribes with whom the Tylangii and (lhahilci are compared
aro not themselves uneqnivooally Germanic.

3. Cesar, describing the same locality, calls the population
Gallia· especially mentioning one of lhe tribes named by Livy the
Veragri.

It may fairly be said that all this creates difficulties, and justifies
the statement that the literal verification of the passage in Livy
involves a considerable amount ol assumption.

Besides this, in order to reconcile Livy with (laser, Zeuss supposed
an intermixture of Gallic immigrants and German aborigines. This
introduces menter difficulties than it removes.

In the first place, the Germane in question, if aboriginal, were
disconnected lrom their nearest congeners hy the whole of Helvetia,
a locality confessedly Gallio.

Secondly‚ a mountain-fastness like the Mons Penninus was not
likely to be a spot from which Ganls would displace Germana

N o remark has been made upon the etymologica themselves. They
are derivations which certain readers will be as slow to abendon, as
others are to admit. Neither ie the undoubted Gallio form of the

word Veragri insisted on ς since, although aGellic word, it might
be the designation ol'a German nation-just aa Welsh is in our
language, a name applied to Welshmen‚ but nota Welsh word.

On the other hand, it may be urged, that the Veragri may have
been semi-German without Gaesar's knowing it, or that (laesar may
have known them to be semi-Germano without thinking it necessary
