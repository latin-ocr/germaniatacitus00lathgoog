Such the difficulties attending the doctrine of an original
amicula os area aad suluqucat displacemcat.

The other alternative, cr that of simple migration, requires
three facts tc beborna iu mind-

a. That it is nc further from the Dardanellcs to the Indus
than from the Indus tc the Dardanelles.

l. That the real conquesta of Alexander (especially that

which led to the establishment of the Greek kingdom of
Bactria) differed from such a European conquest as is neccs-
sary to account for· all the phenomena of the Sanskrit aud
allied languages in date, magnitude, and duration only—220,
in depree though not in kind.

c. That the Majiar conquest of Hungary differs only in
date; for, certainly, it would bea bold statement to assent
that a similar conquest of an area of equal magnitude on the
Indus, on the part of the Europeans of Thrace and the
Luwer Danube, at a sufficiently early date, would not account
for all the points of likeness between the Hindu and the
European. The lihelihood of such an event happeniug, is
measured by the actual conquesta cf the Macedonicus.

Such is the balance of the difficulties of the two hypotheses;
the conclusion iu the mind of the present writer being that if
we consider the Sanskrit to be Asiatic, in the way that the
Majiar is Europam, we escape the unnecessary multiplication
cf causes, and avoid assumptione cf which the number and
amount has never been fairly measured.

How far the Jals of India are Get-ce, is a difficolt question.

The magnitude of tlre area in which the coincidence occurs
is quite large enough to allow us tc consider it occidental.
Still, a case may be made out the other way. Ι
