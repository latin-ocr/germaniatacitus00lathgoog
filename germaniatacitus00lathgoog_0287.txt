tion, and, as such, have failed in attracting notice, or developinga
name.

Ptolemy’s notice of the populations whose name end in -dord
(and in Ptolemy there are sao euch) introduces a difficulty.

He first places Langobardi (Λαγγοξάρόοι) west and south of the
Anglian Suevi (Σουῆέοι oi Ἀγγειλοί), these latter being on the
Middle Elbe.

Athervards he places Λακκοέἅρδοι between the Chauci Majores
aad the Suevi3 conterminans with the Angrivarii and Dulgubini
(Δουλγοῦμνιοι).

This complication may, possibly, appear unimportant ; so that
the inquirer may, perhaps, think himself justified in disposing of it
at once by assuming either an error in the reading, or an oversight
in the author. Possibly, this view is right. Nevertheless, it ie by no
means necessarily so. The word in question is acompound, of which
the qualifying element comes first. Hence, it is sariram impossible
that whilst Langobardi means awa raith barda (beardo or dalheim as
the case may be) of one sort, Lakkobards' may mean meo aiat borda
(beardo, dre) of another. True it is that the elementa Loag· and
Lokle are suspiciously alilre 5 neither can any satisfactory meaning be
given to the latter word. Nevartheless, the inference os their being
the same word ie sariram conclusive. Gompound words may he
alilre and yet different 3 as are Wessea and Esses.

Zeuss gives a full, perhaps an excessive, import to this differenda,
considering that the Lakkobards' were not only the subsequent oon-
querors os Italy under Alboin (which the Langobardi were not)
but that Ptolemy lrnowingly and intentionally distinguished between
the two—“ Diese Σουῆξοι liinnen also nieht mit den Langobarden,
den Ereberern Italicus, werwechselt werden ; Ptolemaeus selbst,
echeint es, will sie unterschieden wissen, dass er diese, die sehon in
getrennten Sitzen ausgestellt sind, obwohl ihr name derselbe ist,
auch verschieden harroto'pdor benennt.'’—p. 95.

Again-“Mit den Σουῆξοι Λαγγοξᾶρδοι des Ptolemaeus diirfen
nicht verweeheelt werden aeine Λακκοξάρδοι, drc.”-p. 109.

It is doubtful, however, whether Ptolemy's own text requires thie
distinction to be thus stringently insisted on, ia, if we take the
Angrivarii to be the centra for our inquiries, and admit anm to
represent their locality.—See ξ xxxiii.

'l'hus—a. 'lhe Saevi Langobardi are conterminans with the
Bmtdere' Minores (Booodarrpor oi μικροί) and the Septembri. Ol*
