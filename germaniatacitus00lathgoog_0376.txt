But. besides thiu negative character os being rum-Slnvnnic
(aud iheresore called 6¹4), the two populations in question
may lmve been really connected*

A reason in favour os this (ns sai· as it goes) is found
in the fuet of the Slnvoninns differing from the Germana
in the following particulare :--

The Germnns called ull non-Germane by ono nnme—
Weallo.

The Slavoninns varied the name with the different non-
Slnvonie population· with which they came in contum.

Thus—they enll the Finns Tuln‘ul, und the Germane
Nivmcy; und this is a reason for thinking that they mlle-i
none G-x, bnt the Lithnaninns.

Nu objections lie against the Θεία and Gotlunm being
equally Lioehnanic. from the mere magnitude os the uren.
If Slnvunians cnnld extend from Servin to Polaud, Lithn-
nniuns might from Bnlgnrin w Prusaia.

The objections that ariae from the present limited aren
of the Lithunninn tongue are but slight. The liu-its of that
tangue have ever reeeded.

Lasily, it should be remembered. ihnt whatever faeta
brought the Gothones nemer to the Gemini, brought them
neuter to the θεία also.
