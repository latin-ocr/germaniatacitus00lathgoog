this the case in ethnologyt No. The Russian language,
although northern in locality, is southern instructum, being
more ahin to the Servian, with which it is notin conteret,
than the Polish with which it is. Nay, more, tho older
the specimens of the language the more it approaches the
Old (lhurch-languago, or the Old Slavonic.

This is by no means an irrelevant question even in German
ethnology. For that of southern Europe and Asia it is all·
important.

The greater the area we give to the Germana of Tacitus,
the less room vve leave for the numerous Sarmatian popula-
tions now in existence; and the less room we leave for these,
the greater the difficulty of accounting for their wide diffusior.

By supposing, however, that they originated in so large
a country as Russia vva meet this difficulty, since wa thereby
allow ourselves a vast tract of land to draw upon for tho
several migratione necessary to account for tha present
presence of Poles in Poland‚ Serbs in Silesia, Tsheks in
Bohemia, Slovaks in Hungary, and Corinthiam, (horatiana,
and Dalmatiam, elsewhere.

But what if the internal evidence derived from the paucity
of Russian dialecto, or (changing the expression) tho uni·
formity of that tongne cvera vast area indicate—as such
phenomena do indicate-a recent introduction anda rapid
diffusiont In this case, the difficulty remains as before,
and we must not only exclude a great number of Slavonians
from the countries of the west, but from the valley of the
Dnieper also.

Now, from all thatl collect from the langnage of the
best Slavonic scholare, the Russian tongne in Russia seems
full as newas the Anglo-Saxon isin England; in other words,
its dialecto are fewer and less marked than those of the
English of Great Britain.

On the other hand, it is in the south and wast that such
differences arc the most marked aud the most numerous.
