Lastly-although ve can, by considering the Batavian Chatti
to have beenan inconsiderable and intrusive population, get over
the difficulty arising out of the HighGerman dialect of the Chatti,
and the PlattDeutsch of the present people οἰ Holland‚ we are not
at liberty to do so. According to Tacitus, the Batavi were so far
from standing alone, that the Oaainefates vere in the same category,
-“ Oaninefates ..... ea gens partem insula colit, origine, lingua
virtute par Batavis, numero superantur.”-Hist. iv. 15.

² M attimar-The mention os the warm bathe of the Mattiaci-
“ Mattiaci iu Germania sontes calidi trans Rhenum ” (Pliny, xxxi 2),
-fixes them iu the neighbourhood os Wishaden. This amr
inference3 and there seems no good reason for refining cuit The
fact ola mixed army of Otuut', vapsi, and Mattiaci, besicging
Mayence confirma this view. “Magantiaci obsessores mixtus ex
Chattis, Usipiis, Mattiacis exercitus.”-Tac. Hist. iv. 37.-Zeuss, p. 99.

Niebuhr expressly states that, in the reigns of Augustus and
Tiberius, Suabia vves not yet subject to Rome 3 his reason being
that no mention is made os any attacks upon Germany south of
the Lahn. Although this view rests upon negative evidence, and
is qualilied by the statement that all that is known about this war
is vagne and indefinite, the a priori probabilities are in favour of
it, and it would be hypercritical to retine upon it.

Domitian's actions in Germany are, probably, undervalued.
Niebuhr mentions his war with the Chatti about the Maine. He
also admits the evidence of medals as to the title of emnem
borne by Domitian 3 buthe demurs to the evidence of Martial as to
its being deserved 3 adding that “the historians are unanimous that
those victories vere not realities, though they cannot be wholly
fictitious.’' ln the subsequent lecture, he supplies tha additional
statement that the ‘⁶ Aroe Flsreioe, the name of a place on the military
road from the Maine to Augsburg, proves that, probably under Domi·
