Straho'a notice of the Rhoaohaai is as follows 2-‘H δ’
ὑπερκειμένη πᾶσα χώρα τοῦ λεχθέντος μεταξὺ Βορυσθένους
καὶ Ἴστρου, πρώτη μέν ε’στιν ἡ τῶν Γετῶν ἐρημία· ἔπειτα
οἱ Τυριηέται· μεθ’ οὓς οἱ Ἰάζυγες Σαρμάται, καὶ οἱ Βασίλειοι
λεγόμενοι, καὶ Οὖριγοι, τὸ μὲν πλέον νομάδες, ὀλίγοι δὲ καὶ
ιγεωργίας ἐπιμελούμενοι· τούτους φασὶ καὶ παρὰ τὸν Ἴστρον
οίιιεῖν, ἐφ’ εἰιάτερα πολλάκις. Ῥωξολονοὶ δ’ ιἰριιτιιιώτατοι
τά μεταξὺ τοῦ Τανάϊδος καὶ τοῦ Βορυσθένους νεμόμενοι
πεδία. Ἡ γάρ προσάρκτιος πᾶσα άπὸ Γερμανίας μέχρι τῆς
Κασπίας πεδιάς ἐστιν, ἣν ἴσμεν ὑπὲρ δὲ τῶν Ῥωξολανῶν εί
τινες οἰκοῦσιν, οὐκ lapsa-Strabo, vii. p. 306.

From this it follows that modern Rauola has taken its
name, not-

a. From any dominant Norae conquerors, ao·called; but—

h. From a portion ol its area called Ilaotai, originally occu-
pied by Ugrian Baetaokaaa but afterwards by Norsemen
(chiefly Suades), to whom the neighbouring natione extended

the name of the territory.
In other words, the Northmen of Baotei were called Ilus,

even aa an Angle of Britannia might he called Britaaaao.

The Ῥῶς were connected with the Varaayi, but, as the
Varaayi were connected with the Franks in name only, the
two previous sections have been, to a certain extent, epi-
sodical.

Ι. True occupante of Frank localities, and probably true
members of a Frank confederacy are the Chattuarii.

This is no Low German form of the word (ίΙιαι-ιιαιίίς
although, at the first view, it seems such; since the single ι
has a less tendency to become t than the double one; or
(changing the expression), the High German ι most usually
becomes t in Low German when the vowel that precedes itia
short. Now, the α in Olor-uarii is long; since it represents
the a in name of the river Ηαιι. Hence, Olor-narii and
Olatt-uarii are aot in the same relation to each other aa

Heraeis to ataui.
