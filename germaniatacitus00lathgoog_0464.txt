mants, and the languagc of the copyists oi the MSS, espe-

Now, it is not stating too much to say that all this con-
stitutes a wholly new and undeveloped line of criticism.
· That different authors should differ in the forms they give
the different new and strange names which they meet with in
, the geography of imperfectly known countries is natural; but
that one and the same author should vary is strange. Yet
such has been the case with both Strabo and Ptolemy, aud

consideration. Nothing, however, in ethnology is isolate and ·
unconnected; and few points of the earth's surface are so

brought to bear upon each other.

Now the case which was made out in the § on the Gotho,
