compared ιο Herse, and applied ιο the populationes its original area,
it denotes the Frisii of Tacitus, the present Frieslanderscf Frieeland,
with a minimum amount of alteration.

As ιο whether the name itself be German, it would be an unne-
cesaary refinement ιο doubt it. Nerertheless, the criticism which
applies ιο the word Sacri isapplicable ιο Frisii also. It is applica·
oe ‚· bnt, although applicable, it by nc means follows thet it should

be applied. By considering the term ae Kelte'c a few difficulties re·
specting the connection between the Frisii and Chauci might, per·
hapa, be removed. On the other hand, we have Pliny’s word Frisia-
boaes ,· a compound almost certainly German.

The shadow of uncertainty that rests over the language ιο which
. the root Fris· belongs, is created by the sact cf the Frisii being
mentioned by Ceasar, under the name now before us: for (ἕκατι

from the native one.
Again; the name ol the national hero is so often the name cf the

hero is so often an epicopatus to the nation-that when this is not
the case, a slight presumption is raised against the name being
indigenous, native, and vernacular. This is the case here. The
great mythological Frisian is Fines. We should expect some such
name aa Fris

Thus, in the Traweller’s Scng, we have—

“ Fin Folo-walding

“Finn, the ιιι of Folcwalda
(Ruled) the race of Frisians.”

All this, however, may be, and probably is, over-refinement.

The later form which the word Frisii takes is one in -re, the so·
called weak form of the Gothic grammarians. Hence, whilst Tacitus,
Pliny, Ptolemy‚ and Dion, write Frisii, Φρίσσιοι, and Φρείσιοι, Proco-

The Anglc-Saxon writers also use the form in -ers,· ep, Freaoaea
in Beda, and Frisaa in the AngloSaxon Chronicle.

The form Prista-bones, in Pliny, has been already noticed. Itis
clearly a compound. The power and original form os the second
