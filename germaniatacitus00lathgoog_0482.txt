On the Evidence of a connection between the cimbri and
the Chersonesus Cimbrica. By Dr. R. G. Latham.

It is considered that the evidence of any local connection
between the Cimbri conquered by Marius, and the (lher-
sonesus Cimbrica, is insufficient to counterbalance the natural
improbability of a long and difficult national migration. of
such a connection, however, the identity of name and the con-
current belief of respectable writers are paimei sacia evidence.
Thia, however, is dieposcd of, if such a theory as the following
can be established, viz, that, for certain reasons, the know-
ledge of the precise origin and locality of the nations oon·
quered by Marius was, at an early period, confused and inde·
finite3 that new countries were made known without giving
any further information3 that hence, the locality of the Oimbri
was always pushed forwards beyond the limite of 'the geogra-
phical areas accurately ascertained; and finally, that thus
their supposed locality retrograded continually northwardS,
until it fixed in the districts of Sleswick and J utland, where
the barrier of thesea, and the increase of geographical know·
ledge (with one exception) preventcd it from getting farther.
Now this view arises out of the examination of the langnage
of the historiens and geographers as examined in order, from

8311ΠΙ to Ptolemy.
