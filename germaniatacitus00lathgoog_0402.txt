Whether, however, it be stmng enough to set against the
series of fsets with which the investiption oommeneed, eom-
bined with the easy explanation of thern by the hypothesin
thot the word was originally other thau German, is submittet!
to the consideration of the render.

All the difficulties are redneible to o single fuet, viz,
that the present undoubtedly Germa-n name Suabt'a has arisen
out of a Bonum rather than a nativo appellatum—the Renum
name itself having orisen out ot* a Keltie, the Keltie, perhaps,
ont of a Slovonie. Whoever makes a difficulty of thio should
rememher that the word Gemany itself is iu the same
predicament.

But this implies that the anoestors of the present Suabiam
became suffleiently Romanized to take sor themselves a nstionsl
nome, which the Romans had originally taken from the Gaulo
—a strange name, in short. The following extr-sets suggest
