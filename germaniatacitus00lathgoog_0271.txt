124 run ennurwr or ricinus.

Thirdly, mixed with PlattDeutsoh forms of different descriptione.

The distribution, however, to as far as it has hitherto gone, bas
applied to the Continent only, not to the islands.

In those of the North Sea, or those on the meam side, it is as
follows:

a. In sehr (which from being oentml it is convenient to begin
with) we have Dans-um, Utters-um, Hedehus-am, Vim-um, Niebelum,
Baldihsum, Vreks-um, Oevensecm, Mitt-um, Alkers-um, Borgs-urn,
Nost-um, Klintum, Olds-um, Duns-um.

b. In Sylt, Horu-um, Meream, Arksum, Koitum, Tinn-um-all
in tlte sentim leals of Nee seland.

o. ln northern Romo, Nost-um.

d. ln Fano, none.

e. f. y. ln Amrbm (to the soreth of Sylt), in Pelvorm, and in Nord-
stant, none. Here the names are Platt·Deutsoh

If we now look baok upon the distribution of looal names in the
Cimbris peninsula, we shall find that-

a. There is a part purely Frisian, ie, the parts between Tondern
and Husum.

b. A part mixed with Danish, ie, North Jutland.

e. A part mixed with Plattlleutsoh, ia, Ditmarsh3 and, besides
those-

d. Parts where there isan intermixture of different degrees of
complexity of Frisian, Danish, and PlattDeutsolu

Now in the parts about Husum‚ ie, the parts where the endings
are most purely Frisian, the lanyuuye is ot tte, present moment
Frieiaa-the North Frisian so·oalled. Ι bave heard it spoken,
and, imperfeetly spoken it, myself this very year.

Audin the islands of the North Sea, and many parts about it, there
either is North Frisian, or, has been so, within the memory of man.

And in Eydersted and Ditmarsh it has been so within the his·
torioal period.

Is this Frisian new or oldl Have the populations who speak it
enoroaohed upon the other occupants of the peninsula or vioe
beravi l 'Phe latter is the case. Some of the reasons for this state·
ment have already been given. They applied, however, only to the
relations between the Low Gennaes and the Frisians. 'ibose of the
Danes require further notioe.

1. rte North Frisiavi lanyuaqeis no recent latrocinalium-a. It
falls into numerous dialeots and sub-dialeots. For tho islands
