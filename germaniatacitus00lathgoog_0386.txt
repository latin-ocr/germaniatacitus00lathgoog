lii-anemio, we may simply suppose them to be Franks of
adifferent division of the Frank name.

All that follows from the proposed latitude given to the
name Marcomanni, follows from the proposed latitudo given
to the name Frank.

Indead, if we look at their geographioal distribution, we
elrall find that the Franks were the Morelmen of the Roman
frontier; aud l submit to the reader the doctrine, that
they called themselves Franks because they were so, aa, iu
oppositiou to their sellun-Germane, who were subject to
Rome.

Α German of the Decumates agri was not a Frank (though
he might be an Alemone), because he was not really free.

The Burgundian of the interior country was not a Frank.
Really free hewas; but as his freedom was not contrasted
with the dependenue of his neighbours‚ it was not necessary
for him to eall himself so. ,

What is gained by the hypothesis? To say nothing about
the minor migratione, it gets over (amongst others) the fol-
lowing grean difficulty.

The Franks of Fraueouia are Han· those of the Lower
Ruina, Low Germane.

Such the hypothesis.

Ι. Tne Franks os lle southern frontina—Probus had to deal
with both Alemanni and Franks. It is probobk that these
were the Franks of Franeonia.

The Franks whom Aurelian chastised were certainly so;
aud, upon the whole, I think it is these Franconian Franks
(the Franks of the Upper Rhiue) who appear earliest
in history. Eveu if they do not, they appear far too soon
to have the name aeeouuted for by any conquesta or migra-
tions; movements either way, from the Upper to the Lusor,
or from the Lower to the Upper Ruina, involving equally
great, though different difficulties.

The measure of the southern, or Fraueouiau Frank eon·
quest‚ is to be found in the name Franco-comta this being
to them as Alsatia isto the AlemauuoSueviaus, and Bur-
gundy to the Burgundians.
