Χ , THE GERMANY or vacuus,

Blacks of St. Domingo speak French and Spanish. But, not
to go so far, no man believes that every inhabitant of the
British Principality who speaks English, to the exclusion of
Welsh, is as Anglo-Saxon in blood and pedigree as he is in
tongue. Neither does he think this in respect to his Scotch
aud Irish follow-citizens. lndeed, every man who, being born
of parents of different natione, speaks only ona langnage, is
more national in his speech thau he is in his origin.

Within the limits of Germany itself this distinction is not
only well illustrated, but it must necessarily bc borne in
mind.

What is the history of our own langnage! Thronghcnt
the whole length and breadth of continental Germany there
is not only no dialect that can bc called English, but- un-
deniably as our Auglo-Saxon mother-tongue was German
in origin— there is no dialect which can bc said to have
originated in the same source; no descendant of the Angle
form of speech.

The same applies to the allied dialect of the Old Saxons.
Where that was oncc spoken, Platt·Deutsch and High
German are now the exclusive idioms; no descendants from
anything Saxon, bnt descendants from membcrs of the
Proper German groups.

Extinct as are these two dialects, it is by no means
reasonable to imagine a similar extinction of Anglo·Saxon
and Old Saxon blood. Difficult as the traces of it arc to
detect, they may fairly bc supposed to exist.

What applies to the AngloSaxon and the Old-Saxon
applies to the MoesoGothic also.

Though no existing dialect can be traced to it, it cannot
be doubted but that the blood of the ancestors of the Ostro-
Goths and Visi-Goths must run in the veins of some southern
Germana—few or many as thc case may be.

Hence the evidence of langnage is primd facie evidence
only.

Such is the measure of its absolate valna—a measure which
subtracta from its importsnce. ,

But what if langnage bathe only test we have; or, if not

the only one, thc one whose value transcende that of all the
