But this rentrietion of ita applieation to a single non-
Keltie populntion is by no menne necessary: since the word
is quite ns likely ιο be in the predicament os the Germanic
berun Welsh, ne in thnt of the Slnvonie rma ,⁴ the word
Welul being applied not only by the English of Englnnd
tn their fenon-citizens of the prineipnlity. but by the Ger-
rnnna of Germnny to the Italiam of Itnly.

Now what if δυσο- be really n root like mlh, ἀι, Β rom¹

If euch be the enee, more than one difficulty would lind its
solution.

In the first plave, il. would amount for so many Slnvonic
populations being denignnted ns θωπί.

In the second, it would supplyn plausible origin sor ulie

The phonetic eyelems of tlte Slavonic ancl Keltic, each so

Ser-b, Sorb, m· Sero (the nativo deeignatiou os the Slavo-
ninus), cuke in the mouth of a Gaul. the form Sauo, Suab, or
Suco—and such l believe to have been the ense.

Of oourse, this viow requires ιο bo supported by evidence,
that the Keltekad n name for the Slavoninns nt nlla und
(although the present is nol the pluam where it will be ex-
hibieed) such evi-‘lenm can be given. The hypothesis niso
requires that thie nome, ne the designatum of n nem-Kenio
populntinn, should bave been given to a Slnvonic aetion first.
I think that thie aleo ean be made probel&⁴ lt· so, we munt
suppose that the south-eastern Gnuls, nnd the most weetern
