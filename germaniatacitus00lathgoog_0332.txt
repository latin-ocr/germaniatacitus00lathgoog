EPILEGOMENA. v

Now, the name ot' each of these populations gives their
localities.

ο. Tra-dantes is the oldest form of the Dutch district
Twento, in Overijsel.

b. Ampsivarii = Emis-were, occupante of the (Upper) Eme

Both seem ιο have been on the OlcnocoFrteian frontier
(perhaps as Morclrocn), and, consequently, it is difficolt to
give them their exact ethnological position.

That considerable displacement occurred in these parteis
certain. The annihilation of the Ampeioordi is not so.

The name reappears in the fourth century—“ Pauci ex
Ampsivariis et Chattis, Marcomere duee, in ulterioribus
collium jugis apparuere.”—Sulpie. Alex. ep. Gregor. Toron.
2, 9.

The Ampsivarii of Tacitus are, almost certainly, the Ἀμ-
ψίονοι of Strabo. Whether they are also the napptavot of
thet writer is doubtful—See Epibymneno.

5. Ouninesotes.—The locality now called Isia-heim, and
Koa-mere in North Holland, is considered to retain the root
Oon· of the componnd form; the power of the final elemento
being unknown, and the evidence of the word being a com·
pound at all being, consequently, inconclusive. Such, how-
ever, it probably is.

The Oaninefates are mentioned in Hist. iv. 15, 16, l8.

They are closely connected with the Batavi ; a fact, which,
as fer as it goes, ia in favour of that population being native
rather than of Hecaton origin-See note in vv. sedutti, and
ᾗ Batti, in Epilepomeoo.

A measure of the extent to which absolute and implicit faith
is to be placed in each and every statement, of even so great
a writer es Tacitus, ia to found in his account of the Jews,
whom he brings from (lrete. Yet it was easier to write
eorrectly about the Jews, than about the populations of

Gouriand, Gallicis, and Poland.

Α dea Tucsooo, Tanfana, or Tamiana is mentioned as e
local goddess of the Marsi.
