Thus, the sounds akin to the 9 in gna, and the kin kind, are
' not equally distributed over the Bohemiau, the Polish, the
Russian, and the Lithuanic. No Slavonic tongue has the

four souans of 9, k, kt, and t. Each has two or three of
them. hus—

Hence, where the Poles say 9, the Bohemians say Μ
whereas the Russian spells such foreign words as Her-old and
Hertzop, Gerold and Gerco93 there being no sign for h. So
that if a Bohemian and Lusatian wished to pronounce such a
name as Got, as a Pole pronounced it, he would fail in doing
so, and say Hot instead; and oica verset, a Lett would
change Hot into Get.

Ι admit that these facts require the initial in the words
Jotae, and suttorp, to be H rather thau J.† On the other
haud, Ι think that, as H is the modern form, J may have

been the older one3 in other words, that the change fremy
toll may not have been direct and immediate, but as fol-

lows 2-9, j( ), ll.
I submit that these remarks are sufficient reasons for the

existence of smne difference at least in the forms of the names
in question, if not for the exact differences which we actually
lind. Thus much concerning the change from p tc j (y).

The one from j to o can, in like manner, be shown to be,
no arbitrary assumption, but a true and proper letter-change
of the Slavonic·Lithnanic languages.
