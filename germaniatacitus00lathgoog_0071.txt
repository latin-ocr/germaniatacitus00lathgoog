In the name Cherusci some of the best writers of Germony
find the root hcmc=eword Hence, the Cherusci are swords,
and, by extension, morde-mco.

But there is another nation mentioned by Tacitus, called
Scardona. Saord=sword,· and, hence, Otomsci=Snord
onos, and olco oorcd.

Thirdly, as salc=doygcrr dagges-:swerd the Saccus are
the men of the sote. Hence, normanorum: Cherusci,
ond the three tribes arc the saure.

Ι give this as an illustmtion of 'an investigation; valuable,
if true. But the tmth is doubtful.

ln most investigatione of this sort, two series of facts are
overlooked. ¹

l. The langnage to which the derivational process is
applied-How many have sought for a German meaning
to the word Germani, without submitting it to the previous
inquiry aa to whether the name were German at all.

2. The likelihood of thc name isselt-1 will not deny
that nations may bo found who give themselves such names
as Sword, Daggsr, Knc‘fo, &c l only argue that the induction
by which ench names can be shown fitting toan unknown
case, has yet to be mado.

A fact that eminently invalidates this kind of criticism.
is the habit of numerous natione themselves. Many of them
are eo far from suppoeiug that their name has au iutelligible
origin, that they exhibit an unconscious confession of their
ignorance. The Greeks (for instance) and many Oriental
natione explain their name by supposing that it is that of

.= the patriarch of their stock-their eponymus. Thus the
Halteres darive themselves from Hellen, the Turdo from
ank, dvc. They would not do this if, in the full command
of their own tongue, and in a period comparatively near
the origin of their name, there was some custom or attri-
bute connected with themselves which would explain it
better. ’

Ι think the etymology of simplo ancompoundod national
names dangerous and unscieutific. ln a few cases it is admis-
sible—but only in a few. In tho present volume I adopt tho

accredited meaning of three simplo anomnponnded nomes only
