NOTES.

The remarks on the extent to which a Slavouic form in
-mtsb- might be presumed when there was a confusion
between -se- and ot· (see note in v. Narisci), was written
before Ι found in L. G. Daae's work on the Lithuanian Family
that the actual Slevonic form for the German combinatioo
St, is stret (e'e' in Bohemian, aare in Polish, and tabo in
Russian)‚ end that the Polish original of Stiegletz is ezczygiel.
Such being the case, it is not too much to suggest that the
very existence of a confusion between -ετ- and -ac-‚ is primd
socie evidence of the true and original form being ebich, and
cousequently of the word in which it occurs being Slavonic;
for it is only in Slavonic that ench combinatione occur.

ln p. 91 there is a material oversight. The Boii are
placed between the Mane, Rhine, and Hercynian Forest.
They ought to have been placed in the parts beyond the area
thus circumscribed. I say this oversight is neoterici ,· since
the true position of the Boii was nearer Bohemia than the
text of note in o. Boiohemwm makes it. Still, the correction
by no means carries it as far east as Bohemia; since the plain
meaning of ulteriore is not aoy part east of the Maine, but
the parts that immediately (there or thereabouts) succeed, or
come next to, the Helvetiae occupancy. Now, these are
parts (and no inconsiderable parts either) of Bavaria. Bohe-
mia, undoubtedly, comes afterwards in the same direction;
but so do Gallicia and many other places. The common-
sense interpretation seems to be that where the Helvetians

left off, the Boii began. Still, the statement in the text
referred to is an over-statement.
