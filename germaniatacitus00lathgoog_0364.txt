mitted be a roal one; otherwise, the tradition is only the
tradition of an opinion, aa, no tradition at all.

A tradition, too, must be different from an informes.
All trad-itione thot coincide citt inserentes are auspicium or
(changing the expression), att insereocee which piac ns tho
rome resulta aa o tradition wacken ita vattdiry (ta, that of the
tradition).

This, perhaps, requires illustration.

In England there existed, at tho timo of Beda, three
populations; one called Anyti, one Socerum, and one some-
times Jnta but ostener Vita. In Hampshire, the sarona
and Vite, or Jatae, came iu contaot.

Similarly, in the parts about the Lower Elbo and
Eyder, there existed three similarly-named populations;
ono called Anyti, one Scaurus, and one sometimes Vitae, but
oltener lota. In Sleswick the Sacram and Jotae, or Vita,
came iu contact.

Now Beda writes that tho Jctae of England came from
the Jutae of Jcrland; and his statement generally (perhaps
universally) is supposed to rest on either history or tradition.

Ibelievo it to rest on neither the one nor the other. I
believe it to be an inserente-au insertare so logically correct,
that Ι only wonder at the combination of chauces which
make it actually wrong.

N evertheless, the truth was as follows. The people of the Islc
of Wight were called Vitae, oven as the people of Jntland were.

And, thc people of the Isle of Wight, thus called, lay in
geographica} contact with certaiu Saxons; those Saxone being
in similar contact with certain Angles. All this was also
the case with the Jutlanders.

Such coincidences wanted accountiug for. A migration
did this; and a migration was insorrod.

The extent to which the similarity of name between Gothi
and Getae might engsuder a similar insererem, similarly resem-
bling a tradition, weakeus the historical likelihood of the
truth of J ornaudes' account.

Such are some of the reasons for considering his derivation
of tho Germana (or Goths) of the Danube from the shores of
the Baltic, as highly exceptionable.
