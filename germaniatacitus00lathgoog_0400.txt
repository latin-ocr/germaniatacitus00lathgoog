The only doubt is abont its being occlusimty Kenio, ia,
not German.

The reason in favour of this view are, perhaps, all resemble
to one head, niz.. the facts which the hypothesis will account
for. of these the chief are-

i. The ymarclity of the term, as seen by the express
evidence of Tacitus himself.

2. The equally express evidence of Tacitus ιο the fact of
a general or common name for the Gennans being reccath·
and of that name being Garatoni-not Saevi.

3. The difficulty cl making it apply ιο any great dictem
ol the Germanic stock. For such, we have already, in the
names Ingaevones, Istaevones, and Herminones, more than we
can easily deal with.

4. The non-mentiones the name Chatti in (iasar, combined
the high probability of some, at least, of Oasar's Saevi having
belonged to that branch. ⁰

5. The fact of Tacitus, who places the Utotti in Gaesar's
loculity of the Snevi, placing the Suevi tc the east cf it.

6. The difficulty cf accounting for this by means of a
migration. Tbcugh Gaesar has no mention of the chatti,
and Tacitus has, it is not Tacitus who first notices them.
The name appears in Strabo. Hence, ii there were a real
bodily change of locality cn the part of the Snevi, thus
supposed to have been driven eastwards by the chatti, the
displacement mnst have occurred between the time cf Oaesar
and Strabo, ia, between the time of Julius and Augustus
Caesar-and that without either the Romans cf Gaul or the
Germans noticing it.

chever, what a migraticn will not explain, the assump-
tion of the word Saevi being a synonym to some of the
previous names coiit. Sami may mean otoni. Saevi may

mean Hannondcri, or it may (as Ι believe it does) partiolly
coincide with tort.

But what explains the synonymi Nothing better than the
existence of a second language, especially when that second
language is no fiction, but a reality.

What lies against thist Ι will put the only strong argu-
ment on this side of the question in its strongest form. From
