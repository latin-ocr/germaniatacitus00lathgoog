Badeu three-fourths of Wurtemburg, Hobenaollern, end s small

corner of Bataua.

Physically, they form the districtos the Black Forest and the
Rauhe Alpe, and consist of s tobielem, containing the head-wetere
of tho Neokar.

⁴ bimite octo.]-Was this limes s ditch. wall, or rampart, or was
it a physical bouudary; in other words, does limes mean an artificisl
orauatural line of demarcationi The reference to Frontinus in

the previous note partiolly answers this. The limes was an artijtcc'ul
bouudary.

Between the bend os the Neokar and the upper partos the river
Altmuhl, in the neighbourhood of Ohringen, are the remeius of a
fortified ditch. On the Upper Altmuhl they can be traced afrosh3
aud they re·appear on the Danube, between Pforing and Kelheim.
Part or the whole of this is called the Teufelsmouer, or Deoil'c Walc.

Δ, The infereuce that it is of Roman origin is unexoeptionable. The
⁴ r exact liue, however, has not,I believe, been worked out. Noither

has its connection or nouconnection with the Pseud-(ircim.

'l'he PfoletGrabeu is a similar line, running at nearly right angles
with the river Lahn, between Giessen aud Orteuburg.

For practioal purposes, a rough conventional linc will do as well
asareel one. This may be drawn so as to make the lima run from
the Maiae to Kelheim, ie, from the junction of the Maine and Rhine,
to the junction oi the Altmuhl and Danube. This gives to the

Romans rather mors than Zanes. and rather less than Niebuhr allows
theru.
