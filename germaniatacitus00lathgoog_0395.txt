Like Tacitus, Dion makes no mention 01 the Chattu-arii.
Strabo does3 his form being Χαττουάριοι.
So does Velleius Paterculus; his form being Atta-arii.

Ptolemy's Χαιτούωροι introduce a complication which will
be notieed in the sequel.

The locality 01 the Ohatt-uarii 01 Strabo and Paterculus
was the watershed of the Ruhr aud Lippe. Strabo mentions
them in conjunction with the Gambrivii, and Paterculus with
the Bructeri—“ Intrate protinus Germania, subacti Gauius·
fetes, Attuarii, Bructeri, recepti Cherusci.”-ii. 105. ·

They increase in historica] prominence as we advance; and
in the reign 01 Julian, Ammianus writes “Rheno exinde
transmisso regionem subito pervasit Francorum quos Arre
ories vocant.'' —xx. 10.

Between the eighth and eleventh centurias the nemeis
common, and numerous documenta speak 01 the terro, pagus
and comitatus 01 the Ototuurii, Hattoarii, Hazzcarii,* Atre·
arii, Hottero,† and Hatera, and numerous places are men·
tioned as lying within it.

All these leyen the western side 01 the Rhine‚ ia, on
the Niers, a feeder 01 the Maas; so that the minute ethno-
logist may divide the Attuarii 01 the middle-age writers into
the eastern and western branches.

“ In no. 715 Senones vastaverunt terram Ototuarioramf
-Annak S. Amand. Pertz. i. 6.

But the most interesting fact connected with the Chatt-
sarit is the occurrence 01 their native name Hoetware in the
Travelier's Song, and Beownlf.

The king, whose son, the hero 01 the great Angie epic,
Beownlf, succeeded, bore a nome the form 01 which was-—

In ns, Higedrc-

In Icelandic, Hopleilcr-

In Latin, C'lroclu'ldichus,¹
being, voriorrsly called, a Daue, aGeat, and an Angle.

His descent upon one 01 the pagi 01 King Theodoric 18 thus
mentioned by Gregory 01 Tours :-“ His ita gestis Dani curn
rege sno, nomine Ohochilaicho, evectu navali per mare

* A near approach to thc form Chasuarii.
† Compare this with Bructeri, as opposed to Bornctunrr'r'.
