these, they lie to the mullo, and a very little extension westwards
will carry their frontier up to that of the Armi-varii.
b. Now it is the Angriuarii which the Λακκόέαρδοι suooeod: the ¹

Angrivarian area being the only one which separatos the two
langobarda

Still both the interruption and the difference of form must be
taken as they are found ; and explained rather than denied.

In Staffordshire, and many other parts of England, syllables .

ending in -c’np, are pronounoed inqk. Suppose this to hare been the
case with some dialect in Gennany, from which the notice of a
people called Langobardos was derived The sound would then be
Laoylc-obardoo. To a Greek no way of spelling this would be more
natural than by -rx-; since it was by ayy· that he already spelt the
sound of erp.

'Phe langobardi of Velleius are essentially those of Ptolemy,
aa, Neruae Gemens-⁴¹ Recepta Chaucorum nationes...fraoti
Langobardi, gens etiam Germana feritate ferocior; denique...

so are those of Tacitus-although they follow the Saevi in the
order of description, they are connected with the undoubtedly
northern Anyti, dre.

It is sale, then, to say that the langobard area was either discon-
tinuous and interrupted‚ or else exeeedingly sinuous and irregular in
outline.

It is not so easy to accountlfor this.

a If it were certain that b-rd=beerd; and-

b. If it were also certain that the length ol heard was a charae-
teristio of the Chatti, it would be fair to consider them aa an intrusire,
conquering, immigrant portiones that people-i.c., High Germane
within the Saxon area

But as neither of these points is certain, the relations of the
langobards are uncertain also.

They may either be intrusicc or frapomrtory.

o. Immadrae-If they be this, the population from whioh they
originated may be either the High Germanic Chatti, or the Low
German Sicambri.

b. Frapmeatory.-If this, they may represent Saxons whose arsa
has been encroached on

They may be many other things besides
