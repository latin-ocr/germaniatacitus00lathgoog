The reasons for thc existence of a Lithuanic population in
scandinavia, lie chiefly iu the facts which it will account
for. But this requires us to be sure that there is no other
alternative. ’

If the existence of a Germanic population will uot account
for the presence of the form Gr (with its varicties) in Scan·

The only two that present themselves for consideration,
are the vinnandam Lithuanic.

The fact of the root iu question being known to be Lithu-
anic‚ and not known to he Finnic, is primii sacia in favour
of the former.

The Lithuanian is the only known family of which it

This leaves Ga as the only known name applicable.

Reasons for its being the one actually applied, arc,-

a. It was, besides being the native, the diaconio name as

d. It was from the Slavonians that the Scandinavian
Germans were likely to take the name of a population‚ between

The Lithuaniaus then, south oi the Balsio, are called by
the ancestors of the present Danes‚ Swedes‚ and NorwegianS,
G-r. surely, the same name, applied by the same people on
the nortl of the Baltio, is likely to have been applied to
Lithuanians also.
