words, 1 believe the name to be nativo in one of the two caseo
only ; so that the Goth-ini were (Η ,only in the eyes of
their Slnvonie neighbours,jnst ae a Peloponnesian was n Greek
in the eyes of aRoman only: whereas the Goaelumoa (Guttmn.
Sto.) were G-l in the eyes of their Slavonie neighbonrs und
themselves us well, even ne the Γξαῒιως of Epirus wne doubly
Greek: Greek when he epuke of himself, and Greek when
he wne spoken of by a Roman.

The reason fm- drawing this distinction i.- ne follows :—

α, There is no evidence of the numerous Lithuanie popula-
tione ever having had a collectiva or ymml name of their
own. however much they may have had one given thern by their
Slavonie neighbmrre: in both of these respecta being exaetly
in the same case ae the Genuam.

b. Fur the :pontific name of a particular Litlmaninn populn-
εἱσι-ι (ie, for a nune equivalent to Chatti, Cher-unci, of similar
divisione of the Gomam'), the term Gothones (Gothini, aut,
lones. Sam). if exten-<led from Gnlliein to Gouriand. is of im-
probable (1 do not say impossible), exuent. No single action
of a population ie likely ιο have had su large nn aren.

ο. The difference between the nme of the people (Gotbim').
nnd their langunge (Gallica), suggests the likelihoorl of the
nativo uf the Gorln'm‘ having been some form of Gal
(Hal, hm). In England, in the sixteenth und aeventeenth
centuria, the generality uf writers epoke of the pewh of
Gennany ne Ger-mam bnt of the lanyuaye, ns Dutch, High
Dutch. οι· Low Dutch, ne the enee might be. Henee, we hem-d
of translatione from tho Hiyh Dutch, even though the people
who epol-xe it were called Germane

Now I consider that the same Slnvoninne who spoke of
the peuple of Gallicini as aarum· (n presumed Slnvonie form),
were aleo those who epoke of their langnage aa Gallic (a pre-
sumed native form); even ns one and the same populntion (the
English) epoke of tho Dutch tangue and the Gar-man people.

And 1 also consider that thone same slavoniam called the
lnngnnge of tho Gothini Gallie, bet-nnec Gallio was the
nativa name os it ς just ns the Suel. uf Dutch being the native
nam-² of the German, accunnls fur the terme Higb Dutch and
Low Dutch.
