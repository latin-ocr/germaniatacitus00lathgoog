their neighbourhood-The Gothones are separated from the ⁸

Lygii, the Gothini from the Sarmatae.

3. Both were—according to the evidence—neither Ger-
man nor Sarmatiam since the Sarmata treated the Go-
thini as oliaaipanae, and the AEuii spoke what Tacitus calls
Brittot.

Do these three points of connection establish an ethnolo·
gioal affinity?

I will lay down what Ι conceive to be an hypothesis capable
of solving all, or nearly all, the difficulties arising from what
may be called the pluripreaauco of the root Ga, (att, in the
two names under consideration.

This is as follows: the root, att, was, in the ease of
the Slavouic and Lithnanian populations, in the same predi-
cament with the root (la-lc, in the case of the Hellenic and
Italian.

With the Hellenas, Γραῒκοι was the name of a single popn·

lation within what, in the eyes of a Roman, constituted the
Hellenic area3 and the name was, almost certainly, native.

With the italiana, it was the name, not only for that par·
ticular tribe, but for· the collective Hellenas also.

diritatis nectendis—With the Lithnanians the Ga (ca-d,
G-tt) was tlre name of a single population within what, in the
eyes of a Slavonian‚ constituted the Lithuanic area, and the
name was, almost certainly, native.

With the Slaronians it was the name not only of that
particular tribe, bnt for the collective Littuoaiens also.

Thus—the AEatit' of Tacitus, the Euate of the Germana
were called Guttones (Gottones) by the more northern
Slavonians of their frontierr just as the spotiatus of Epirus
were called Greci by the ltalians of the opposite coast.

And, the Gottiui of Tacitus were called by a similar name
by the more southern Slavonians of their frontier, just aa the
Athenian Hellenos and others were called Grani by the
Roman, Campanian, and other ltalians.

Such is the hypothesis, lprefer this to believing that the
Gotlonas and Gotliar' were so much and so thoroughly one
and the sante scotica of the same braetot as for thom to have
borne the saure name from Gallicia to Oonrland; in other
