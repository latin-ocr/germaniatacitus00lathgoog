some notable points of contrast. Dent-selae as a name for Gemmas,
in the sense in which it occurs in the sciath century, was an impos·
sibility in the first, or second. This is not sufficiently considered.
Many believe that the Tene, in Teutones, is the deuo, in deoc-set.
To be this ecoctly is impossible. Any German tribe that called
itself peuda, Diot, or Decii in the first century must have givena
different meaning to the word ; and, so doing, have called them· ·
salves 1133311333, heroes, or by. some term equally complimentary 3-
certainly not by any word meaning epeolaere of the vulgar torique.

This is to prepare the reader for some further criticism, which
will occur in the sequel.

Allemagne and Lamagna are merely modemiaed forms of the
name of a particular section of tho Germane, the 11133333πί.

The English name, as already stated, isa translation of the
Roman one.

Germani, then, isa name given by the Romans to the populatione
who afterwards called themselves Dentatis& and Geromaio is the
Roman equivalent to Dentsctland; whilst Gennaes and ormana are
English forms of the Roman designation.

It by no means, however, follows, that because the Romans called
a certain people by a certain name, that that name was Roaiam
although reasons have been given* for considering that it is the
Latin word 9333331.

1 believe, for my own part, that the word was Keltic 3 in other
words, that whilst the Germane themselves had no collective name
at all, the Romans called them what they were called by the Gauls.
’1113 meaning of this Gallio designation is a matter of legitimate
speculation. At present, it is sufficient to fur the langarage in which
the etymology is to be sought.

The date of the first mention of the name German is more curicus
than important. A distinction, however, connected with the inves-
tigation of it 13 necessary.

The earliest date assigned to an event in German history is one
thing 3 the earliest historian who mentions such an event 13 another.
A very early event may be recorded by a very late historiam

'Phe word semiGemowir was applied to the natione who, as early
as the second Carthaginien war, came across Hannibal in his passage
of the Alps. But, early as this is for the fact itself, the historiam
who recorda it is late-Livy.
