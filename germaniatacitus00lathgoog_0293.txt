So does the undoubted Germanic cocupuncy ol the island.

So do its relations to tho Elbe and Weser.

Aa the same time claime bave been asserted for the Isle of Rugen
in the Baltic.

Rugcn is full ol sacred antiquities; and, at the beginning of the
historical period, was, perhaps, more unequivooally a Hcly laland
than Heliyotcacl, in fact, though not in name.

But at the beginning of the historical period, the rites, creed, and
population were Slauom'c.

of course, by considering the Rupit of ἑ 43 aa Germanic, this
objection is neutralized.

But Ι more than doubt whether this can be done.

Aeto the Reudigni, damnes, Anyti, Varini, Eudoses, Scardowea,
and Nuithones, collectively, we must remember, that, at the beginning
oi the historical period, the Slavonians of the Lower Elbe are found
so sarwcstwards as to make it doubtful whether the German frontier
-thc Northern Germano-Slawonic March-can be carried much
farther castward than tho Hertz.

Larceabnrg, was the occupancy of the Potabi, a remarkable name.
Po=oa and Labu=1llbia=the Erae, the Slavonio formos that
name. Hence the Polabi were to the Elbe as the Pomorum oi
Pomerania to the sea (pc=on, and more=sea). Slaronic as this
form was, it was adopted by the Germans3 and became a hybrid
word by means cf the affix -inp —Po-lab-s'npi‚ a word boli German
and hals Slavonic in form, but wholly Slavcnic in power.

Mecklmbarp was the country of the Obotriti; Luaebarg of the
Liaones, whose Slavonic longae was extant till mn. 1700. The
details of the Slaronians cf litt-mark are obscure, but as it is certain
that Luchcw and Danneberg in the north were Slavonic, and that
southwards there were numerous Slavonians in the directiones
Saxony, we may, provisionalty, consider that a line drawn from
Hamburg to Jena represents the Old SlavonoGermanic March,
in its oldest form. Afterwards, the Suale forms the boundary.

That the Varini were Slavonic is only likely. that theAnpli were
German is certata Hence—
