into Britain. But that, again, is to assume the point instead
of proving it.

Some, at least, of the Belga, were Gallie in regard to their
constitution—witness the Eburones, who were clieatee to the
Treviri.

The names (ay, those beginning in trc- and corr) were

Gallio. This is an argument which the present writer, has,
at the first view, no right to use; he has so often suggested
theta population speaking one language, might have a name
in another. In this case, however, he may do so; since
Gaesar was in tho country of the Belgae, and, if their names
were German, might have tahen them in a German form.
Had he never crossed the Seine, it would not have been
illegitimate to arguo, that Keltic names for Belgio localities
and populations, were not incompatible with a Germanic
desoent for the people.

Neither is he, perhaps, justified in laying much stress ou
the degree to which the extension of Germanic tribes to
the Seine, would diminish the Gallio population, supposed to
be so great; since he has shown but few scruples in contrast-
ing the Germanic. Still we must remember three points

a. First, that the recognition of the Belgae as German,
would subtract all the country north of the Seine, from
Gallia.

d. That it would place Germans on the Straits of Dover,
the most probable point for the introduction of the population
of Britain into Kent, a country which we know was not
German but Gallio. ⁶

e. That, as tbe Aquitanians were Iberic, it would only
leave the parta between the Seine and Loire for the Kelts.

ln the analysis of the arguments in favour of a wide
extension of Germane into Gaul, it will generally be found-

a. That, as a general question, too much importance is
attached to the notion that common political relations
denote common ethnological ones.

b. That certain particular expressions of Gaesar, showing
that, in some of the instances before us, there were specifio
signs of Gallio origin, aro omitted: ay, Gativolcus, a Belgian,

says, ‘⁴ non facile Gallos Gallis negare potuisse‚''-B{ll. Gall.
