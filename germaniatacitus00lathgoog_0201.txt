Instead, then, of doubtfully suggesting the identity of Oica and
Isis, name for name, as is done by Grimm, Ι have no hesitation in
assenting to it.

Whether traces of the characteristic muiyium can be found
in an equally satisfactory form, is another question. A long
quotation from Rodols's Chronicle of the Abbey of St. Trudo,
is to be found in D. Μ. i. pp. ast-241. It tells us that, sm.
1133, the country-people of the neighbourhood made a ship, put it
on whee1s‚ rolled it about from town to town, and attended it with
song and dance from Tongres to Louvain.

This was done to annoy the weavers. It also annoyed the
clergy. So much so, that such expressions as accim infausto omine
compactam -yeatititote's stodiam-profanus amussi excubias—dor·
tutantur ut cantaretur-sualica spiritus qui iss illa serebamus-
iafoesti ominis mucram, dre, occur in the account

Ι agree with Grimm in thinking this particular processioa,
although mentioned as a single instance, to have been but the last
of many previous ones-in other words, a revisat of an old custom.

I also believe its origin to haye been pagan.

But I am not satisfied that it has anything to do with either
Isis or Ziza.

a. The locality os the processioa was the parts about the Lower
Rhine and Mosella, that of Ziza, Bacasis, and that of eren the Isis
of Tacitus the country of only pora Suevorum3 so that whilst the
deity is pre-eminently local, the custom is spread over a wast
area.

b. Processions of the kind in question are common, without being
connected with ’ one another. 'l'he celebration of the breaking-up of
the icc, and the beginning of the season for navigation might easily
be celebrated on the Danube and on the Rhine with a similar cere·
monial‚ without the necessity of supposing the one to bave borrowed
the custom from the other.

Something of this kind I imagine to have been the osee with the
supposed analogue of the nauigium Isidis in (termam, boats being
. wbeeled about at the beginning of the sailing season, justas on the
aab of J anuary, or Haupt-Monday, the labouring men os some parts

of England go about as Ploupbboys, or Plcetgltbullocka
That either the Isis of Tacitus, or the Ziza* of the Augsburgers
