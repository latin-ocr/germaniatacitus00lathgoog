PROLEGOMBNA· xv

As far, then, ss this goes we are unable to drew upon
Russia as the source of the Sarmatian populations of the
countries in question; e fect which should open our eyes
to the difficulties amongst which we place ourselves by too
implicitly believing that the ancient Germane originally ex·
tended indefinitely far eastwards.

Neither can we go too far nortl for the parent country of
the slavonicus-since, as late as the tenth century, we have
historical evidence in favour of the Finnic stock having
extended as far south as the Veldai mountains, between (κ

appreciate the full import of the polaeontoloyieol character of
ethnological reasoning—the palaeontologieal method meaning

The historian requires it to be pointed out.

the Lower Rhine and Weser, is of very different value from
his statement concerning the Semnones, Lemovii, and the
natione beyond the Elbe. The former was collected, either
directly or indirectly, from men who visited the localities
described, fought in them, marched in them, sailed up their
rivers, and acted as pioneers across their fens. The latter

are based upon such information as the people of the parts
which were known could supply concerning the unknown
parts beyond them. As time advanced, however, the more
remote countries beyond the Elbe, beyond the Weser, and
beyond the Vistula, became known even as the terri-
tories of the catti and Cherusci were knowns so that in-
