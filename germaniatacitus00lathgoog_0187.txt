c. Frcmec is either a clerical error, or a mistalrc 100 franco.

b. Franco was a weapon used by the Franks, from whom it took ,
110 name.

1 will lay before the readsr all that can be said in favour 01 this view.

a. As admitted, the change from fr· to psr-is not 01 0 common
kind.

b. In the old uncial MS. Nc and M are often confused.

c. Franco in single-Sama and srakkc in Norse=jaoelin.

d. The Spaniards called aces francisca after the Franks-“ secures
—quas 01 Hispani ab usu Francorum, per derivationem Frcuciacos
vocant.”-Isid. Hispal. xviii. 6, 3.

Observa, that in this last case, the writer who finds an ascl, bodkio,
as too unlilre a dupper to connect psrieme with framea, finds no dif-
ficulty in connecting an ace with a y’csoelin.

’ Observa, too, that framisec, as an adjective, can, at best, but
mean the Frcakisb wecpoo.

01 the single-Sason and Norse forms, france and fraleta, Ι 1)] no
means undersalue the importance.

Now let us look 10 tbe assumptione requisita 100 this view.

In Juvenal the word occurs, throughout the MSS, as framea.

In Tacitus it occurs seven times, and, throughout the MSS, as
framea.

Surely the lihelihood 01 11ιο M becoming NG, as opposed to this,
is only a presumption against a 1001. ’

But the first Roman writer who, by using the word, introduced
it into Rome, may have written frama for franco, and sothe error
hare been propagated. This, I submit, 10 only valid against some-
thing else equally hypothetical. It is not enough to say that an
author may blunder. If it were so, any man might believe or
disbelieve what he chooses. The particular lihelihood 01 each
blunder must be shown.

Still the assumption may possibly be legitimate 3 since it is pos-
sible that the hypothesis, which arises out 01 thern, may clear away
numerous and considerable difficulties, do away with numerous and
considerable improbabilities, and so gain credence on the strength 01

the phenomena ior which it will account.

Iret us sce what 10 done in this way.

It does just the contrary to what it ought.

The Frardcs, under the name 01 Fraus, appear in history, 100
the first time, in the 00000κί century-no earlier.
