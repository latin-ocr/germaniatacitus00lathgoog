importanoe. But what is that ol the geographical area now called
Bohemial So unknown was that remarkable country to the Greeks
and Romans, that ita obscurity was that of the central parts os Africa
in our own time. There was a reason lor this. Its natural moun·
talu-rampart would preserve it from invasion.

These same mountain-ramparts, however, which would thus tend
to keep the country inviolate, in the case ol a war, could hardly
escape notice and description. Yet no such notices and descrip-
tione exiet. Os the present Bohemia, we find no aaeguiuocat ae-
count whatever in any Roman writer. Equivocal accounts we do
find : but these are got at by assuming the Marcomannic kingdom
ol Maroboduus to have lain within Bohemia, and as they apply to
this Marcomannic kingdom only, they ceaee to be Bohemian as soon
as the Marcomanni are placed elsewhere

It may simplil'y the question to anticipato.

' Ι beheve the Botobevcam of Tacitus to have been, not Bohemie,
hut Bouaria.

Bovario and Bobemic are nearly the same words

a. The first clement in eachis the proper name Boii. In the
sixth and seventh centuries the fuller form ol Bavaria is Bojoaria,
Bai-eoric, Bojoaria‚ Baio-varab dvc.

b. 'Phe second element is equivalent ia poscor, though not ia sorra,
to the second clement in Bobems'a. Itis the word wure=e⁰nbabitoatr
or occupante in the AngloSaxon form, Oaatware=people ochut.

Hence Bobenia=the Boion occupatam Baearia=tlse usurpant
Boione.

This leads us to the fact that however much we may place the
Bottia Bobenia, we cannot do so exclusively. As sar aethe neme
goes, there were Boii in Bavaria aa well 3 Boii, too, who gave their
name to their land.

But this is not enough. We require substantive prool beyond
the inferente arising from the similarity of name l'or this latter fact.
At present the argument stands thus :-

Botohem, in the time of Tacitus, meant Bovario. Not so, may be
the answer. It is granted that only one locality may be intended
by the two names, but why may not Bouaria originally have meant
Bohemial The answer to this must rest on its own grounds.

Itis no small argument in favour of the original single power
of the two names, to lind that the alternative just indicated is a
real one. Zeuss expends much learning upon it, giving reasons
