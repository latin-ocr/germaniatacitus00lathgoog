Germane had their ancient rocyo that servcd as recorda.
And what event so important as the previous loss and sub
sequent ro-couquest of twothirds ol tbeir indigenous soil!

ln short, the migratione iu question must come under tbe
following conditions :-

a. They must be of anparallcled magnitude aud com-
pleteness-

ὂ. Of unparalleled rapidity-

a. Unrecorded in any history—

d. Unreprescnted by any tradition-

a. Aecompanied bytho strange pheuomenon of replacemcnt
and substitution ; aud-

ᾗ lx. uranonomcan cuassmca'rrolt OF THE REMAINING EUBOPRAN
POPULATIONS·

The third chapter has served to illustrate thc principles oi
ethnological classificatiou; since it has shown that natione as
different aethe Icelauder aud the Swiss may bc comprized
in one general division ; in other words that aetoek comprises
populations as different from each other ee the Bavarians, the
Dutch, the Swedes, the Faroe islanders and the Americans
of the United States. Hence the Gothic stock is aaa of the
stocks ol which vve bave a pretty clear idea.

Another such a stock is the Classical. This comprises the
Latina and Greeks-ancient and modern. Besides which it,
to a certain extent, comprises the Spaniards, the Portu-
gaeso, the French, certain Swiss populations, aud the Wal-
lachians3 iu all of which countries the language is derived from
the Latiar the population being mixed, ia, partly consisting

of Roman, partly of aboriginal blood. Now, recognising the
great Classical stock as an ethnologieal equivalent to the
Gothic, and comparing the extent to which a Wallachian
differs iram an Italian or a modern Greek of the other, vve
have a convenient measure of the impert of the word storin·
since vve see the amount of differenee implied by it.

*t Vir. by that divisiones the European populations which, within the his-
torical pcrrod, hus retreaerd before thr Germanic rather thau crrcrouchcd on it.
