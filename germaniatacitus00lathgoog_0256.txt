¹ crinem barbamque summittere.]-'Phe whole evidence of anti·
quity is to the abundant looks os the Germane, and ιο their yellow
hue. From the customs of some os the Frisian or Norae popu·
lation, especially that of the supposed Norae settlements of Mol-
qaerum and Hindelopen in Friesland, as they appear in the
twelfth and thirteenth centurias, it is probably that this golden or
ffixsn hae was artificially heightened, s'.e., by alkaline washes of
soda or potash ley. The likelihood of this must be borne in
mind when we consider the extent ιο which the present prepon-
derance of dark or brown hair amongst many Germanic popula·
tione is reserable to a real change of colour ; inasmuch as it
possibly may be accountad for by the disuse os the habit os blanch-
ing it.

In all ethnological questione connected with the colour and
texture of the hair, the customs os the country,in respect ιο the
dressing of it, should be caresully attended to. Thus amongst the
islanders of more than one part os the South Sea and Indian
Ocean, where the hair is naturally jethlack, there is the practice
os uashing the head in ash, or lime-water-which gives it a red
tinge. Hair, thus discoloured, has been described hy excellent
writers as being red.

The population wherein really, and naturally, red bair prepon-
derates‚is not German, but Ugrian3 the Votiak‚ and other Finns
of the Volga, being pre-eminently 113be and, Ι think it likely
that when we hear of Germana being thus distinguished (ie, as
red rather than gebaa-haime), these alkaline washes may have
had something to do with the epithet. Sachare common. Silius
Italicus calls t-he Batavian “rafae Batavus.”—iii. 608. More ex·
prees still is the following extract from Galen ε-Οὖτως γοῦν τινὲς
ὀνομάζουσι τοὺς Γερμανοὺς temate, καὶ τοί γε οὐκ ὄντας basileia, ἐὰν
α’κριξῶς τις ἓθὲλοι καλεῖν, dhhd πυῤῥοΰς.

'lbet lacy hair was generally an honourable ornament, we inser
from its being amongst the Franks a sign os being afreeman;
whereas, to have the hair clipped, was a degrading punishment. At
the same time, aa this very passage implies, the German modes of
wearing it were carious. Herodian mentions the κουρά τῶν Γερ-

μανῶν (iv. 7); and Seneca the myas crinis et mactae ia nodum apud
Gmaacoa-De lra, c. 26.
