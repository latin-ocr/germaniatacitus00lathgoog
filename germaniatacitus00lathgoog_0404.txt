So that whether we assume a movement of tho Angla
Saevi from Snabia, or one of the Suebian Saevi from tho
Angle country, or deduce both from sorno intermediato area,
we must assumes change of dialect aa well. Zenss does this;
and deriving, as ho does, tho Suabians from tho aocestors of
the English, believes that tho former took a HighGerman
dialect in placo of their own. Otherwise we may presumo, '
English would be spoken at the present moment in Badon
and Wnrtemburg,—nay, possibly in Switzerland, Bavaria,
and Austris, since these were Alemanno-Suevic conquests.

III. Tto Suooi Trausbudoai. -Between the Saalo, tho
Bodo, and Hartz is a Gau named Suevos. This was occupied
in tho sixth century by a population called by the Frank
writers Saevi.

The following extracta make them recent colonists,—
“ Tempore illo quo Alboinus in Italiam ingressus est, Oblo-
thacharius et Sigihertus Succos aliasque gentes in loco illo

posuerunt.”-Gregory of Tours, v. 15. “ Ohlotarius et Sigis-
bertus roges Francorum Succos aliasque gentos in locis, de‘
quibus iidem Saxones exierant posuerunt.”-Paul. Diaconii. 6.

If the §5 on the Angli and Werini be now referred to,
it will bo seen that tho parts on the Thuringian, Hessian‚
Slavonic, and Saxon frontiers wero parts whereon settlements

appear to have boon mode to a great extent; aod it must
be remembored that the evidence here is of the kind called
cumulatius, ao that, although absolute and unimpeachablo
reasons for any particular population being considered to
have originated in a military colony, cannot be given, thero
are several populations contiguous to each other, for each of
which a small amount of evidence can be collected; the sum
of the probabilities being alargo one.

Sueuos, then, as the namo of a Gau, or pupas, we have
already seen; as also localities for tho Anyti* and tho Woriai.

Besides these, there is, in tho same parts, a Frioooofohf‚ or
field os aa Frisicus,

These Suari of tho Gau named Sueooo, bavo been con-
veniently called tho Suari Trambadovvi, ia, tho Saevi bo·
yond the Bodc‚· since the following passage occursio Witi·
