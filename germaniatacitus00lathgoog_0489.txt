Tacitae-Tacitus coincides with Strabo, iu giving to the
Cimbri a specific locality, aud iu stating special circumstances
01 their history. Let tull neight he given 10 the words 01 a
writer like Tacitus; hut let it also be rememhered that he
wrote from hearsay evidence, that heis anything rather 111111
au independeut witness, 11111 his statement 11 scarcely recon-
cilahle with those of Ptolemy and Oaesar, aud that above all
the locality which both he aud Strabo give the Cimbriis
also the locality of 1111 Sicambri, 01 which 111111 tribe uo
mention is made by Tacitus* although their ware with the
Romanswere matters 01 comparatively recent history. For
my own part, I think, that between a confusion 01 the
cimbri with the Cimnierii ou the oue hand, aud 01 the
Cimbri with the Sicambri ou the other, we have the clue to
the misconceptious assumed at the commencement 01 the
paper. There is no proof that iu the eyes 01 the writers
under the Republic, the origin 01 the Cimbri was a matter 01
either doubt or speculation. Catulus, iu the History 01 his
Consulship, commended by (licere (Brutus, xxxa), and
Sylla in his Commentaries, must have spoken 01 them iu 1
straightforward manner as Ganls, otherwise Cicero and

Sallust would heve spoken 01 them less decidedly. (See
‘ This ought to be “ by Tacitus in his Gernrunio.”-lt. G. L. 1851.
