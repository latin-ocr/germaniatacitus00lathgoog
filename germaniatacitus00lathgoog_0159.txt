Danube takes its great bend southwards, and separates the eastern
Pannonians from the J azyges. The parts of the Gereonio of Tacitus
which reach the Pannonian partos the Danube, coincide with the
present country of Upper Hungary, or the valleys of the Gran and
Waag.

The languages here spoken are, at the present moment reserable
to three familias-1. Gomon in Lower dustria, and on the side
ol' Lower hostria. 2. Slavonic on the side of styria, Oroatia, aud
Slavonia. 3. Majiar, or Proper Hungarian in the central parts.

'l'he present population of Pannonia cannot but be extremely
mixed, since, over and above the present occupante, there have been
successive invasione ol Romans, Goths, Huns, Avars, Gumanians, and
Gepidae. hll this complicatas the inquiry aa to the etbuological
position of the original ante-Roman Pannonians.

0f these two have occurred within the historical period.

The Germana ol Lower Austris are tho Gemens ol Upper dustria
advanced eastwards, and the Germana ol Upper dustria are the
Germane os Bouaria similarly protruded. Their language is refer·
ableto the Alemannic type ; their original ancestors were probably
Alemanni, and the date ol' their occupancy is not earlier than the
fourth century.

rho Majiars are even os later introduction, and their advent even
more within the range of history. It toolx place in the tenth century.

une Goths, Huns, Avars, Cumanians, have all occupied parts os
Pannonia—but all within the historical period, or nearly so. The
aborigines preceded all these.

une original population of Pannonia must be arrived at by the ear-

Now the population that remeius after this is that ol the Slooulrs
of Upper Hungary, who are Slavonians.

The ethnology ol those parts of Pannonia which was not German

is no part of the present work Many reasons, however, beyond
the existence ol the Slovaks could be given for making it Sla-

VOIhutmthe same time, there is but little doubt that the banks of the

Danube were occupied by intrauisse Germana at au early period.
