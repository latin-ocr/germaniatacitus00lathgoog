Ibelievesuch to have been the ease. 'Phe previous occupancy of ⁵
the valley os the N aab (at least) by Germane anterior to the invasion

of the present Bavarians, is necessary to account for their presence
on the Danube, in the second, third, and fourth centuries: besides

which the present text requires it.

The present text also requires that they should be either Hermun-
duri, or closely allied to them.

'l'he reasons for believing tho Hermunduri to have belonged to a
different section of the Germane (indeed to have been the chief
branch os the Meso-uotis) will bs found in the sequel*

Whether the Norisci were Slavonians like their neighbours on the
east, or Germane like their neighbours on the south, is, notwith-
standing the text, an open question.

As N araci, we have no further specifie ethuologieal informatiou
about them.

lf, however, ue allow the Οὓαριστοί of Ptolemy ιο be the same

⁸ people, we get a second notice of them; a notice, however, which
adds nothing to our knowledge, merely doing what is done by
Tacitus, ie, placing them next ιο the Hermunduri (Τεοριοχαῐμαι).

To get any new facts, ue must go further still Let the word
Waresci=0bnpsorof=Narieed

For the Freneh districts of Jura and Doubs, on the banks of
the river from which the latter takes its name, we have the following
notice :-“ Eustasius ad Luxovium regressus est. Deinde ad Wa-
rnseos, qui partem Sequanorum provinoiae et Duvii amnis fluenta ex
utraque ripa incolunt, pergit.”— Vua S. Salaberqoe.

This speaks only to the propte. The following, however, goes
further, and gives us the hypothesis as to their origin :-“ Pergit
(ss. Eustasius) progrediens Warescos ad fidem Domini nostri Jesu
Christi convertit, qui olim de pago, qui dicitur Stodesunpa qui
situs est circa Regnum flumen, partibus Orientis fuerant ejecti,
quique contra Burgundiones pugnam inierunt, sed a primo certamine
terga vertentes, dehinc advenerunt, atque in pugnam reversi, victores
quoque eflecti, iu eodem pago Warescorum consederunt”—Vita S.
Ermenfredi.

There is nothing improbable in this ; the river Regnum being
oonsidered the Repete. Ι have not, however, been more successful than
Zeuss in finding such a name as Stodevunqo on any of the mapa.
