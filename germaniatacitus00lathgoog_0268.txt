2. Dratum, Stockaoa, Bokhum, occur in Old Saxon locali·
ties.

Ι admit this exception, and, although it is by no means im-
possible that either certain Old Saxon localities may once hare
been Frisian, or that Frisian colonias may have been located on
the points in question, consider that the -um may hare been Old
Saxon as well as Frisian—hnt not anything else.

To proceed. In scandinavia, the termination in the root tm
at all, or in any form, is rare. Tha termination that replaces it
ia dm an important affix, and one which plays the same part in
the minute ethnology of Soandinavia that -am does here.

With this preliminary, we may investigate the northern portione
of the Frisian area 3 having hegun with the extremities first.
Slecwiok aad notata-*Just west of Ttndem, about an English

mile to the north, we hare a hamlet called, sor some distance, Bnnder-

in dy.

About four English miles to the north-west of Lech, we hara a
hamlet named Weesdy, and west of this no place ends in day.

About Husum is a remarkable starting-point. Anew set ol
names comes in. These are only partially Frisian 3 at the same

Phanacen.

Howerer, between Husum, Roudon-by, Weesty and thesea, all is

line Rantr-um.

What do we find beyondl First let our attention be turned to
the south, and south-east, so as ιο see whether they are reasons lor
connecting these Frisians of Sleswick with those of Hanorer.
