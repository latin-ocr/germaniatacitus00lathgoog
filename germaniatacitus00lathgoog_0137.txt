sacrificed to the gods of the Germane, who offered burnan
sacrifices for the purpose of ascertainiug the future. Three
legions, with as many alae, and ten cohorte, were cut to
pieces; bnt, owing to the unfortunate divisions among the
Germane, they were unable to make that use of their victory
which Arminius would otherwise bave undoubtedly bave
made. Many of the Roman castella, however, were taken
and destroyed; and much else may have been done, which
the Roman accounts of this catastrophe passed over in
silence*

The details in Strabo are lower than we expect.

They are also those of a Greek and it must be remem-
bered that it vvas only through the Romans that the Greeks
knew much of Germany; in other words, tbeir knowledge

was second-band.

Hence, the distinction between a Gaul rmd a German, so
clear to a Roman, was far from being equally clear to a Greek.
This remark lias been made by Grimm, but without being
acted on. Yet the practica} bearing of it is important.

Even sucb awriter as Gaesar does not wholly confine bis
account of Germany to what he had himself observed. On
the contrary, he quotes Eratosthenes, and indicates the
opinions of other Greeks. Pliny's account is pre-eminently
Greek, whilst Tacitus hus evidently, in more places than one,
allowed his reading to stand in the place of lirsthand investi·
gation. Yet the Greeks were no safe guides; not because
they had no powers of observation, but because it was impos·
sible for thern to know such a country as Germany without
coming in contact with Germane. Still they knew something
of it. They knew that it was the land of a certain atock,
family, or natiou that came under certain negative conditione.

The German was not a Scythica, in the way that the
nativas of the Don were.

Nor an Illyricas, as a Taulantius was.

Nora Sarmatian, as the Jaayges were.
