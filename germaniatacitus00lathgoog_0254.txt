as well es the thaat, and in modern geography, there is a Suabia as
well as a Herae.

1 believe that the difficulty is diminished by the ᾗ on theSueei in
the Epteqomena.

Το the question, why did Goesar call the llatti Suevil the
answers are of two kinds.

1. It may be said that the name had changed in the interval,
either by the preponderanoe of a different hronch of the Consedere-
tion‚ or by some other means.

h. It may be said that the two names belonged ιο different
langnages, and that Sueu- was the name by which the Chatti were
known to (laesar’s informants, the Ganls 3 just as the Kyraty are
known ιο the English by the name of Welsh.

The latter view is the one adopted by the present writer.
'l'hat δοιοί was the Gallio name of the Germana of the Middle
Rhine, 1 feel semein. Whether it was exclusively Gallie, aa,
foreign ιο these same Germana themselves, will be considered in
the § just referred to.

2 Hercynio saltu]-l¹he langnage from whence the first notice of
the Hercyniam range (whether of mountains or woods) was taken,
is probably the Keltic; at least no derivation is so probable as tha
one indicated by Zeuss-ercbyoa=eleuoted, ercbynald=eleoettbm

If so, the portion of the range to which it applied would be the
western, rather than the eastern extremity ; a matter of some im-
portante, since the fact of its having been first used by Greeks
would suggest the contrary notion. As it is, however, we must
suppose that the term reached Aristotle or his informante justas
the words Atp, Kelt, or Gasd (Pdhnrut) did.

ube Hercynian forest, as delineated by Gaesar, only partially
follows the line of the Danube. Thateis, however, a tract in physi-
cal geography with which it coincides entirely. 'l'his is the system
·of highlands or mountains, which forms the northern boundary
of the valley of the Danube. Hence, from west to east, the line
of the southern limit of the tract in question runs from Baden
(Rostrum), where the riversystenr is that of the Rhine, along the
highlands of Wurtemburg (Decumates agri), Franoonia, Bohemia,
Menaria, and Upper Hungary. Here the bend to the left (north)
takes place ; in other words, we have the long flat valley of the
'Pheias (Tibisous) intervening between the mountain-range and the
