Of Appian the whole evidence goes one way, viz.. that the
tribes iu question were Gauls. His expressione aie: πλεῖ-
στον τε καὶ μαχιμώτατον-χρῆμα Κελτῶν εἰς τὴν Ἰταλίαν
καὶ. τὴν Γαλατίαν εἶσέὲαλε.-Εν. 2. In his book on lllyn'n
he states. that the Kelts ancl cimbri, along with tha lllyrim
tribe os tlia Autariae, had, previous to the battle against
Marius, attaekenl Delphi and suffered sor their impiety.
-Ἲλλνρ, 8. 4.

Quintilian may be considered to give us upon the subject
the notione of two writers—virgil, and either Uul-sar οι·
Crassus. Iu dealing, however, with the words of Quintilian,
it will be seen tlmt there are two assumptions. 'l'liat either
(ἔων οι· Crassus considered the Cimbri to be Gauls, wa infer
from the following passage: “Raram est autem, ut oeulis
subjicere contingat (ec. vituperationem), nt fecit Cr Julius, qui
cnm Helvio Manciae saepinu obstrepenti eibi diceret, jam osten-
dam, qualia ain: isque plane instaret interrogatione, qualem
se tandem ostensurus esset, digito demonstravit imaginem
Galli in uento Mariano Cimbrico pictum, eui Mancia tum
simillimus est visus. Tabernae antem erant circum Forum, ae
acutum illud signi gratia positum.”—1nst. Orat. vi. 3, 38.
Pliny tells tha story of crassus (xxxix. 4). Altlmugh in this
passage the word upon which the argument turns has been
written qam, and translated θοοὶ, the narrent interpretation ia
the one given above-VM. uot. ed. Gesner.

In the same author is prenerved the epigram of Virgil'fl
called Catalecta, aad wmmented on by Ausonius of Boi-deunx.
Here we leam that T. Annius Cimber was a Gaul: whilst it
is assumed that there was no other reason tn believe that he
was called Cimber thau that of his being descended from
some slave or sreedmnn of that nationz—“Non apparent
