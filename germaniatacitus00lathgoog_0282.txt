longus are the same3 therefore the Belqoe are Volyores. 'Phia is
no caricature. Mareotis mutandis, the argument alluded ιο runs—

Deraso.

The doctrine of the present writer concaming the ethnology of
these two populations was laid before the Philological Society as far
back as 1844 3 and the article in which it isexhibited, is reprinted
at the end of the present volume, which supersedes tbe necessity of
along note.

'lhe chief addition that he would make to the quotations and
references there found is the following extract from the ldarmor

Maroboduus to have belonged to his empire.

² Veteris fomae-oatiqm]-The disbcliewer of the existence of
either Cimbri or Teutones in Germany, sees in this statement merely
an inferente. (lertain monuments (perhaps θναοΙιόἰι, Tinqatene
or other similar well-known antiquities of the socalled Cimbric
Chersoneso) required explanation. The Roman antiquarios (for it
must be remarked that the text gives us no hint that this view was
native) referred them to the populations in question.
