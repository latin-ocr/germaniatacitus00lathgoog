Morka of minor magnitude may have existed—marks between
different members of the same stoch; between, for instance,
the Catti and Cherusci, the Cherusci and Chauci, &c This,
again, is what we lind at home. The Welsh marches sepa·
rated the Saxon from the Kelt: the Scottish‚ the southron

. Saxcn from the northern. Still l think that the existence of
a march, sufficiently important to be mentioned by the Roman
historiens, is primd facie evidence of the existence of an
ethnological difference of considerable magnitude.

3. The third is the liccat· character of the dimensione ol a
march. A boundary which separatas one area from another
is surely narrower than either of the areas which it separates.
A march as broad as it is long is no march at all. To this,
however, there is an objection. One natiou may so encroach
upon another that the march, cr line of boundaries, is con·
tinually advancing. Now if the acme be retained whilst the
liae becomes protruded‚ the lrcudtl of a march may become
as notable aa its length. Thus, if the North American
settlers had called each county which abutted on the lndian
frontier the march, and if those counties had retained their
names, there would now be a series of areas, ao named,
reaching frunt the Atlantic to the Itocky Mountains. And
this is really the case in Germany, where we have the oldest
lineos frontier between the Sluvoniana and Germana, called
Alt·mark (the old march); the next, Mittel-mcrk (the middle
march); and the third, Ucker-mcrk the march of tha Ucrii
(a Slavonic population sc-called). ·

4. There is also another clement of uncertainty. Suppose
the Humber was called the river March. The people on it
might be called Marctmea, though not on a march. ln such
a case, certain Yorkshiremen would appear to form the fron-
tier, when, really, they did not do so. By this, the writer
who argued from the name only would imagine that the
non-English area began at Hull instead of at Roxburgh;
aud the English area would loss all Yorkshire, Durham‚ aud

Northumberland, '
Now, reverse this supposition, and let the Spcy be called

the March. ln this case, the men on its banks would appear α
