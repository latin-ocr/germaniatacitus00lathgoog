lrom taking up the question at the other end, beginning with
a langnage at the earliest period of its history, inverting thc
previous process, and traciug its progress downwards from its
first, appearance in history to the present time.

We get, by this means, more than one additional Gothic
language. First and foremost comes—

l. Tlos Meso-Gothia-The tribes who spoke this were the
Goths who conquered Moesia; the date of its existence, asa
written language, being the fourth century. The Moeso·
Gothic has no living representative, that is, none of the
present dialects of Germany aro directly and unequivocally

. descended from it; although the Thuringian is, probably,
descended hom some dialect originally allicd to it. From
the fact of its being the oldest Gothic dialectos which we
have any specimen, the philological importauce of the Moesc·
Gothic is very great.

2. lta Alamannia—This is the present literary German as
it was written in the eigbth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh cen· '
turios, and as it was spoken on the Upper Rhine,-in Baden,
Wurtemburg, Switzerland, and Bavaria.

3. rto Francia-This is German cf the middle Rhine, as
it was written in the ninth and tenth centuries.

4. Pto Old notos, namot, or Balearica-This is the pre·
sent Dutch of Holland in its oldest form. It departs from
the Francicmnch astho Francia departs from the Alemannis.
Hence the Dutch of Holland, and the Bavarian of Bavaria,
may be considered as the two extreme forms of one and the
same* group. All the present Platt·Deutsclr dialects of
Germany are either exactly derived from the Francia, or
from some sonu intermediate to the Francia and Batavian:
a view which will be noticed in the sequel.

5. rto Scaea—This falls into two divisione, the Old-
Saxon of Westphalia, and the AngloSaxon of Hanover,
afterwards transplanted to Great Britain. The Saxon lan-
gnage is extinct in Germany, being replaced by the Platt-
Dentsch derivatives of the Francia, or Franco-Batavian.
This circumstance supplies us with a principle of classifrea-
tion, the Platt·Deutsch dialect falling into two divisione-

ὓ viz, the Gemma Proper.-Scc p. ix.
