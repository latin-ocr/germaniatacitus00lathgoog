2. On the other hand, the Romans-

a. Where they spealr from actual knowledge, have no
occasion to refer to the Greeks. ’

ὂ. Where, for want of this, they do so, they follow unsafe
guides.

The ethnology to which this applies most especially, is
that of the Bostcrcoe and Peucini, the Cimbri and Teutonos.

With these pre'liminaries,we may say of the text of Strabo-

o. That where he follows the historiens of Drusus and
Tiberius, he is unexceptionable.

d. That where he follows Posidonius, and such writers
as could bnt have written from what they traferret, rather
than what they knew, he is exceptionable.

What applies to the text of Strabo, as we lind it in Strabo
himself, applica to those statements in subseqnent writers,

1. Εὐθὺς τοίνυν τὰ πέραν τοῦ Ῥήνου μετὰ τοὺς Κελτοὺς πρὸς
τὴν έω κεκλιμένα Γερμανοὶ νέμονται, μικρὸν ἐξαλλάττοντες
τοῦ Κελτικοῦ φύλου, τῷ τε πλεονασμᾷ τῆς ὢγριότητος καὶ

τοῦ μεγέθους, καὶ τῆς ξανθάτητος· τᾶλλα δὲ παραπλήσιοι καὶ
μορφαῖς, καὶ ήθεσι, καὶ βίοις ὄντες, οἵους εἰρήκαμεν τοὺς
Κελτούς. Διὸ δίκαιά μοι δοκοῦσι Ῥωμαῖοι τοῦτο αὐτοῖς ,
θέσθαι τοῦνομα, ὡς ἂν ιγνησίους Γαλάτας φράζειν βουλό-
μενοι· εγνήσιοι ιγὰρ οἱ Γερμανοὶ κατὰ τήν Ῥωμαίων διά-
λεκτον.

Ἐστι δὲτὰ μὲν πρῶτα μέρη τῆς χώρας ταύτης τὰ πρὸς
τῷ Ῥήνῳ μέχρι τῶν ἐκέολῶν άπὸ τῆς πηγῆς ἀρξαμένοις·
σχεδὸν δέ τοι καὶ τοῦτό ἐστι τὸ ἑσπέριον τῆς χώρας
