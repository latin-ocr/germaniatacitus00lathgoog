tained in firmcr state, to vit, in the establishment of a gustantes,
which the English call c Fsiddorgas, with the exception 01 110 111011
01 York, who call it Tenmcanctclc, that is, the number 01 1011 men.
And it consiste in this, that in all thevilla throughout the kingdom,
all men are bound to be in a guarantee by tens, so that' 110110 01 110
1011 men offend, the other nine may hold him to right. But if he
should Ilce, and they allego that they could not have him to right,
then should be given them, by the king‘s justice, a space 01 at least
thirty days and one; and if they could find him they might bring
him 10 justice. But for himself, let him out 01 110 ovvn restore the
damage he has done, or, if the offenoe be so grave, let justice 10 done
